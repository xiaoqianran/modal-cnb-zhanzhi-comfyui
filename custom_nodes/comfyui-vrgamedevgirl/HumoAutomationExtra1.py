CORE CONTEXT:
Character Type:
{character_description.strip()}

Reminder for output format:
Output the prompts as a valid JSON object.
Do NOT nest any additional JSON objects or fields inside each key.
Use sequential keys ("prompt1", "prompt2", ...).
Do not include code formatting, markdown, or any text outside of the JSON.
Do not invent or assume any character details such as hair color, skin tone, age, ethnicity, eye color, body type, or other visual features unless they are explicitly included in the character description.
Send output in json format-
Example: these wrapped in curly brackets

  "prompt1": "A close-up of a woman in soft morning light...",
  "prompt2": "A medium shot of her walking across a foggy bridge...",
  "prompt3": "A wide shot of the city fading into dusk..."



Song Theme / Creative Direction:
{song_theme_style.strip()}

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Read ALL Lyric Fragments First:
- The lyrics below represent one continuous story told across multiple segments.
- Each lyric fragment is ~4 seconds of screen time.
- Short phrases may lack context on their own - you must infer the full action across connected segments.

2. Understand the Full Visual Narrative:
Before writing prompts, determine:
- What is happening physically in this story?
- What is the progression of actions and environments?
- How do locations connect?
- What visual motifs emerge?
- What is the emotional arc?

3. Output Format:
- One prompt per lyric fragment
- Each prompt: {word_count_min}–{word_count_max} words
- Use natural flowing sentences
- Output as json format
- DO NOT output JSON, markdown, or commentary
- ONLY output the prompts

4. {structure_instructions}

5. Self-Contained Descriptions:
Each prompt must stand completely alone. The AI model has NO memory.

FORBIDDEN REFERENCES (never use these):
- "the same woman/man/character"
- "she/he/they/it" (unless restated in full within same prompt)
- "still", "continues", "next", "after", "before", "from earlier"
- Any reference to prior prompts

REQUIRED IN EVERY PROMPT:
- Fully describe character + outfit
- Fully describe environment
- Fully describe lighting

6. Continuity Through Repetition:
- Repeat key elements to maintain continuity
- Do NOT reference earlier prompts - just restate
- Keep outfit and character consistent unless narrative demands change

7. Visual Categories to Include:

Character Visibility Options:
{character_visibility.strip()}

Shot Types:
{shots.strip()}

Environments:
{environment.strip()}

Lighting:
{lighting.strip()}

Camera Motion:
{camera_motion.strip()}

Physical Interactions:
{physical_interaction.strip()}

Facial Expression / Visual Emotion:
{facial_expression.strip()}

Outfit Rules:
{outfit_rules.strip()}

{list_instructions}

9. Language Style:
- Clear, cinematic, visual language
- No poetic metaphors or abstract moods
- No semicolons, colons, or quotation marks
- Emotion shown only through visual elements (composition, light, camera work, gestures)

10. Subject Attributes and Actions:
- All descriptive fragments (body parts, clothing, posture, gestures, accessories, facial features) are bound to the subject unless explicitly separate
- Do not create duplicates or disembodied elements
- Example: "a woman, hands on table" should be "A woman with her hands resting on the table"

LYRIC SEGMENTS (PIPE SEPARATED):

FINAL REMINDERS:
- Read all lyrics first - plan the continuous visual story
- Each segment = ~4 seconds
- Repeat key elements every time
- Never reference earlier prompts
- Each prompt must stand alone
- Make it cinematic: camera, lighting, composition
- Follow user specifications above all else
- Do not invent or assume any character details such as hair color, skin tone, age, ethnicity, eye color, body type, or other visual features unless they are explicitly included in the character description.
- Only send in json format: 
- Example: in curly brackets

  "prompt1": "A wide cinematic shot of a woman standing under neon lights...",
  "prompt2": "A close-up as she turns her face toward the light...",
  "prompt3": "A slow pan as rain falls softly in the background..."

INPUT: Lyric Segments in pipe separated format

Example:

INPUT 2: PIPE Separated Lyric Segments
segment1|segment2|segment3|etc 

INPUT (OPTIONAL): Prompt Structure Pattern

The user may provide a specific pattern for structuring prompts. If provided, use it exactly as specified.
If NO pattern is provided, use the DEFAULT PATTERN below.

DEFAULT PATTERN — Cycle Through Patterns

Cycle through these 4 patterns for variety (40–50 words each):

Pattern 1:
Shot Type → Character + Outfit → Physical Interaction → Environment → Lighting → Camera Motion → Cinematic Detail → Visual Expression

Pattern 2:
Shot Type → Environment → Lighting → Character + Outfit → Physical Interaction → Camera Motion → Cinematic Detail → Visual Expression

Pattern 3:
Shot Type → Physical Interaction → Character + Outfit → Environment → Lighting → Camera Motion → Cinematic Detail → Visual Expression

Pattern 4:
Shot Type → Environment → Physical Interaction → Character + Outfit → Lighting → Camera Motion → Cinematic Detail → Visual Expression

USER OVERRIDE RULE (CRITICAL)

If the user provides ANY details in other inputs

User-provided details ALWAYS override defaults.

Follow their specifications exactly, even if they contradict these rules.

Only fall back to default rules for aspects not specified by the user.

CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING: THE FULL VISUAL NARRATIVE

Before creating prompts, you MUST:

Read all lyric segments completely

They are fragments of ONE continuous visual story.

Each segment = ~4 seconds of video/audio

Understand context-

Short phrases may lack meaning on their own.

Infer the full action across connected segments.

Identify the visual story-

What is happening physically?

What is the progression of actions and environments?

How do locations and visual motifs connect?

PROMPT CREATION RULES-
Rule 1: Self-Contained Descriptions

Each prompt must stand alone. The video model has no memory.

❌ Forbidden references:

"the same woman/man/character"

"she/he/they/it" (unless restated in full within the same prompt)

"still", "continues", "next", "after", "before", "from earlier", etc.

Any reference to prior prompts.

✓ Required:

Fully describe character + outfit every time.

Fully describe environment every time.

Fully describe lighting every time.

Rule 2: Continuity via Repetition

Repeat key elements to maintain continuity (character + outfit, environment, lighting).

Do NOT reference earlier prompts — just restate.

Rule 3: Prompt Structure

Each prompt should flow naturally as sentences and include the following example, but the order depends on the prompt structure.

Shot type

Character + outfit

Physical action

Environment

Lighting

Camera movement

Cinematic details (visual details, atmosphere)

Visual expression (body language, gestures, gaze, etc.)

Rule 4: Word Count

Each prompt: 40–50 words

Natural sentences (no bullet lists)

Rule 5: Language Style

Clear, cinematic, visual language

No poetic metaphors or abstract moods

No semicolons, colons, or quotation marks

Emotion shown only through visual elements (composition, light, camera work, gestures)

Rule 6: Subject Attributes and Actions

All descriptive fragments (body parts, clothing, posture, gestures, accessories, facial features, etc.) are automatically bound to the subject unless explicitly described as separate objects.

Do not generate duplicates or disembodied elements (e.g., "eyes on the table" → subject's gaze is directed at the table, not detached eyes).

Fragments should be understood as conditions or states of the subject, not standalone entities.

Example of correct wording:

"a woman sits, hands on the table" should be:  A woman sits with her hands resting on the table.

"a man, cigarette in mouth" should be: A man smoking a cigarette.

"a child, eyes on the book" should be: A child looking down at the book.

-------------------

EXAMPLE WORKFLOW

FINAL REMINDERS

Read all lyrics first — plan the continuous visual story.

Each segment = ~4 seconds.

Repeat key elements every time.

Never reference earlier prompts.

Each prompt must stand alone.

Make it cinematic: camera, lighting, composition.

Follow user overrides above all else.

Output each prompt as a JSON object with sequential keys.
Do not include markdown, code fences, or commentary.
Do not invent or assume any character details such as hair color, skin tone, age, ethnicity, eye color, body type, or other visual features unless they are explicitly included in the character description.

Example:
{
  "prompt1": "A wide cinematic shot of a woman standing under neon lights...",
  "prompt2": "A close-up as she turns her face toward the light...",
  "prompt3": "A slow pan as rain falls softly in the background..."
