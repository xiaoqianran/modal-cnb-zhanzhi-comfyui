_WHISPER_REPAIR_INSTRUCTIONS = r"""Whisper Segment Repair Prompt

INPUTS
You will receive exactly:
1. WHISPER_TRANSCRIPTION: numbered Whisper segments.
2. MAIN_LYRICS: the correct full lyrics.
3. STYLE_THEME: style/theme for filler replacements only.

TASK
Repair each Whisper segment in place.

MOST IMPORTANT RULE
Do not create a clean lyric sheet.
Do not copy MAIN_LYRICS line by line into the JSON.
Do not make segment1 the first lyric line, segment2 the second lyric line, segment3 the third lyric line, etc.

HOW TO WORK
For each input segment number:
1. Start with the text from that exact same Whisper segment.
2. Find the matching words in MAIN_LYRICS.
3. Fix only misheard words inside that same segment.
4. Write the fixed text to the same output number.

The output for segmentN must be a corrected version of lyricSegmentN.
segmentN must not be based on lyricSegmentN+1.
segmentN must not be based on lyricSegmentN-1.
segmentN must not be based on the next clean line in MAIN_LYRICS.

KEEP WHISPER CHUNKS
If lyricSegmentN contains parts of two or three lyric lines, segmentN must also contain those parts.
If lyricSegmentN starts in the middle of a lyric line, segmentN should also start in the middle.
If lyricSegmentN ends before the lyric line is finished, segmentN should also end before that lyric line is finished.
Do not move leftover words to the next segment unless Whisper already put them there.

FILLER SEGMENTS
Whisper often writes "Thank you." when it detects silence or non-lyric audio.
If lyricSegmentN is filler such as "Thank you." and does not match sung lyrics at that time, replace it with a short new lyric phrase.
The phrase should feel like it happens right after the nearest previous real lyric segment.
Use STYLE_THEME for the phrase.
Use 3 to 8 words.
Do not use an empty string.
Do not use the next real lyric line from MAIN_LYRICS.

KEY CHECK
Return exactly one key for every input segment.
Keys must be exactly "segment1", "segment2", "segment3", and so on.
Never write "segments14".
Never write "lyricSegment14".
Never skip a number.

FINAL SELF-CHECK BEFORE ANSWERING
Check segment2 against lyricSegment2.
Check segment11 against lyricSegment11.
Check segment16 against lyricSegment16.
If any output is just the next clean lyric line instead of the same Whisper chunk, fix it before answering.

OUTPUT
Return JSON only.
No markdown.
No explanation.
Use double quotes.
No trailing commas.
No line breaks inside string values.

FORMAT
{
  "segment1": "corrected version of lyricSegment1",
  "segment2": "corrected version of lyricSegment2",
  "segment3": "corrected version of lyricSegment3"
}"""


_WHISPER_BATCH_REPAIR_INSTRUCTIONS = r"""Repair a small batch of Whisper lyric segments by aligning them to a nearby real lyric window.

INPUTS
You will receive:
1. TARGET_WHISPER_SEGMENTS: the exact segment keys to repair.
2. REAL_LYRIC_WINDOW: nearby real lyrics in song order. Use only these lyric words for corrections.
3. PREVIOUS_REPAIRED_CONTEXT: already repaired segments just before this batch, for continuity only.

TASK
Return one corrected value for each TARGET_WHISPER_SEGMENTS key.

STRICT RULES
- Use only words from REAL_LYRIC_WINDOW for sung lyrics.
- You may fix punctuation, capitalization, spacing, and obvious partial-word breaks.
- Do not invent new lyrics.
- Do not use visual story, style/theme, mood, color, or setting words.
- If a Whisper segment is filler such as "Thank you." and no lyric from REAL_LYRIC_WINDOW belongs there, output "[instrumental]".
- INTRO FILLER EXCEPTION: When a short Whisper segment (1-3 words) at the very start of the song contains the beginning of a longer sung line whose remaining words appear in the next segment, that short segment is Whisper picking up the leading edge of the first vocal entry during a silent or instrumental intro. Output "[instrumental]" for it, even though its individual words appear in REAL_LYRIC_WINDOW. The test: would the full line in REAL_LYRIC_WINDOW still make sense if these few words moved to the start of the next segment? If yes, the short segment is intro filler.
- OUTRO FILLER EXCEPTION: Same pattern at the end of the song. A short trailing fragment (1-3 words) that duplicates the last few words of the previous segment's sung phrase, or appears after the last full sung line, is outro filler. Output "[instrumental]".
- If a filler segment clearly sits where a lyric from REAL_LYRIC_WINDOW belongs, use the matching real lyric words.
- Keep the segment count and key names exactly the same as TARGET_WHISPER_SEGMENTS.
- Keep the batch in song order. Do not jump backward to earlier lyrics outside REAL_LYRIC_WINDOW.
- Do not copy the whole lyric window into every segment.

OUTPUT
Return valid JSON only.
No markdown.
No explanation.
Use double quotes.
No trailing commas.
No line breaks inside string values.

FORMAT

_CONCEPT_PROMPT_INSTRUCTIONS = r"""You are a lyric-to-visual-concept converter.

INPUTS
You will receive:
1. LYRIC_SEGMENT_JSON: corrected lyric segments in order.
2. STORY: the overall story arc.
3. THEME_STYLE: visual style, mood, genre, world, and atmosphere.
4. SUBJECT: the main subject details, provided for downstream use only.
5. LOCATIONS: an optional list of locations or settings that should be used for the visual concepts.

TASK
Create one visual concept for each lyric segment.
These concepts will be sent to another LLM that writes the final text-to-image prompt.
Do not write the final image prompt here.

IMPORTANT
Do not describe the main subject.
Do not include character gender, hair, clothing, face, body, age, identity, or repeated subject details.
The SUBJECT input is provided for downstream use only and must be ignored when writing the concepts.
If a LOCATIONS list is provided, each concept must use one location from that list as its primary setting.
Do not invent a different primary location when LOCATIONS is provided.

STORY FLOW
Make the concepts feel like one continuous story sequence.
Each concept should feel like the next small beat after the previous one.
Show progression in action, location, emotion, stakes, or visual transformation.
When a LOCATIONS list is provided, build the story using locations from that list.
Prefer moving through the listed locations across the sequence in a way that feels like a journey or evolving story.
Avoid making every segment a disconnected literal illustration.
Do not repeat the same scene idea unless the lyrics repeat and the story beat needs to echo.

CONCEPT RULES
Use the matching lyric segment as the main source for the moment.
Use STORY to keep the scene connected across segments.
Use THEME_STYLE for mood, lighting, setting, color, genre, and surreal details.
Each concept must be one sentence.
Each concept must include a clear setting.
If LOCATIONS is provided, that setting must be one of the locations from the LOCATIONS list.
Focus on visible action, environment, emotional tone, props, symbols, and motion.
Make each concept useful for both image generation and later image-to-video motion.
Do not mention camera moves unless the lyric clearly needs motion.
Do not quote the lyric directly unless it is necessary.
Do not explain anything.

LYRIC ANCHOR RULES
Before writing each Prompt, silently identify the concrete anchors in that exact lyric segment:
- objects and places: window, rain, name, silence, flowers, table, thorns, room, heart, glass roses, floor, sugar, kiss, shoulder, bruise, door, shadow, mirror, monster, hands, petals, etc.
- actions and interactions: spelling, talking, answering, breathing, holding, trying not to bleed, cutting, falling, kissing, bruising, asking, whispering, walking out, etc.
- visible states: broken, sharp, poisonous, trembling, damaged, half out of mind, freedom, pain, etc.

Every non-instrumental Prompt must include at least one concrete object or action from its matching lyric segment.
If the lyric segment contains a specific object, that object must appear in the Prompt unless it is impossible to visualize.
If the lyric segment contains an action or interaction, the Prompt must show that action or a clear visual equivalent.
Do not replace lyric anchors with generic mood, glow, color, haze, landscape, or abstract atmosphere.
Do not write a concept that only describes lighting or scenery when the lyric contains an object or action.
Use THEME_STYLE to transform the lyric anchors visually, but never erase them.
For "Instrumental section." or other no-vocal placeholders, create a visual transition that follows STORY and THEME_STYLE; do not invent fake lyric objects.

LOCATION RULES
If LOCATIONS is provided, every Prompt value must begin with one exact location phrase copied from the LOCATIONS list, followed by a colon.
Do not use a location unless it appears in LOCATIONS.
Do not shorten, rename, paraphrase, or replace the location.
If the story needs to stay in the same place, reuse the same exact location phrase.

OUTPUT KEYS
Return one key for every input segment.
Use keys named "Prompt1", "Prompt2", "Prompt3", etc.
Never use "lyricSegment" keys.
Never skip, merge, split, or reorder prompts.

OUTPUT
Return valid JSON only.
No markdown.
No explanation.
Use double quotes.
No trailing commas.
No line breaks inside string values.

FORMAT
{
  "Prompt1": "Exact provided location: a short visual story beat that includes a concrete object or action from segment1, shaped by the story and theme, without describing the subject.",

3. THEME_STYLE: visual style, mood, genre, world, and atmosphere.
4. SUBJECT: the main subject details, for character movement and performance only.

TASK
Create one short image-to-video motion note for each concept prompt.
These notes will be placed into per-scene I2V motion notes in the video builder.

RULES
- Write camera motion, character/performance motion, environmental motion, and mood pacing.
- Use the concept prompt as the main source for each scene.
- Use SUBJECT only for broad performance or body motion when useful.
