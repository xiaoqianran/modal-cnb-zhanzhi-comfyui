# 🎬 AI Music Video Workflow (ComfyUI) V8

This workflow takes a **reference image** and an **audio file** to automatically generate a stylized **AI-driven music video**.  
It splits audio into lyric-based snippets, generates visual prompts, and combines everything into a synced final video.

## 🟦 Step 1: Upload Reference Image 👉
The reference image is your **main character** throughout the music video.

- Use **Load Image** to import your reference.  
- The **Background Removal** node removes the image background.  
- Use **Resize Image v2** to adjust to video aspect ratio:  
  - `Crop` if it already matches.  
  - `Pad` if not, to avoid cutting details.  

✅ A clean, resized preview of your performer will be shown here.

---

## 🟦 Step 2: Choose Audio File 👉
Load your track and prepare it for lyric syncing.

- Import your audio file with **Load Audio**.  
- The **Mel-Band RoFormer** nodes separate **vocals** from **instruments**.  
- If you already have a **vocals-only file**, bypass the separation nodes.  

✅ This ensures lyrics sync properly with generated scenes.

---

## 🟦 Step 3: Update Folder name 👉
Choose the folder name. Not a path anymore. The folder will automaticly be creaed in the comfyUI/output folder.
- I recommend using the song name as the folder name.
- If you forgot to change this on a new run, it "should" create a new folder with the same name and add V2 at the end to prevent failure.
- Just keep an eye on the idex and if this does not change from 0 on the next run cancel the process and update the folder name.

---

## 🟦 Step 4: Prompt Creator 👉
This node structures prompts that guide video generation.
Need help coming up with ideas? I created this GPT that provides you will all the details based off the song. Just give it the lyrics, hit enter and get a full list to use, get ideas from or tweak.

### How to Use
- Use **short, comma-separated phrases** (e.g., `rain-slicked street, neon lights`).  
- **Avoid long sentences** — think like a **shot list**.  
- Stick with defaults if unsure.

### Key Fields
- **character_description:** Performer’s look (e.g., `A woman`, `tattoos`).  
- **Overall Theme/Style:** Mood (e.g., `cinematic, melancholic, dreamlike`).  
- **pipe_separated_lyrics:** Auto-filled from transcription.  
- **word_count_min / word_count_max:** Default `30–50`.  
- **environment:** Settings (`abandoned house, moonlit street`).  
- **lighting:** Style (`moody shadows, neon glow`).  
- **camera_motion:** Movement (`dolly, pan, zoom`).  
- **physical_interaction:** Gestures (`touch walls, walk through smoke`).  
- **facial_expression:** Emotions (`intense, calm`).  
- **shots:** Shot types (`close-up, wide angle`).  
- **outfit_rules:** Look (`white dress, leather jacket`).  
- **character_visibility:** How often performer appears.
- **New drop down option called "list handling".** This will tell the LLM how to use your comma separted lists. **Strict Cycle** will use each one once then repeat. **Reference Guide** will use everything as a guide/reference along with the lyrics. **Random Selection** will grab from the list at random. **Free Interperation**. The LLM can ignore or combine things from your list. 

✅ The filled-out fields are expanded by the **LLM Node** into cinematic scene prompts, then split across video chunks by the **Prompt Splitter Node**.

# High level overview of the main node in this workflow-
# 🎧 VRGDG_LoadAudioSplit_HUMO_TranscribeV3

A powerful **ComfyUI custom node** that automates **audio segmentation, transcription, and project management** for HuMo / VRGDG-style workflows.

This node takes an audio clip, splits it into 16 evenly timed segments, optionally transcribes each segment using **OpenAI Whisper**, manages metadata and output folders, and provides visual workflow instructions through **ComfyUI popups**.

---

## 🧩 Overview

`VRGDG_LoadAudioSplit_HUMO_TranscribeV3` simplifies large audio-to-video pipelines by:
- Splitting an input audio file into **scene-length chunks** (e.g., 4 seconds each).
- Managing **multi-run workflows** for long audio clips.
- Automatically **detecting project state** and versioning output folders.
- Optionally **transcribing each scene** using OpenAI Whisper-Large-V3.
- Sending **color-coded popup instructions** to ComfyUI.

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. **Audio Analysis**
- Determines sample rate, duration, and frame counts.
- Adjusts frame counts to match **HuMo** (rounded to `(4n + 1)` frames).
- Splits the waveform into **16 equal-length segments**.

### 2. **Metadata Management**
- Stores project info in `.project_metadata.json`.
- Detects if the same audio is being reprocessed.
- Creates versioned folders (`_v2`, `_v3`, etc.) if a new audio file is detected.

### 3. **Set Indexing**
- Counts how many audio sets (`*-audio.mp4`) already exist.
- Determines the **current run index** and **how many total runs** are required.

### 4. **Auto Queueing**
- Optionally adds future runs to ComfyUI’s execution queue.
- Avoids re-queuing during intermediate runs.

### 5. **Transcription (Optional)**
- Uses `openai/whisper-large-v3` to generate text from each segment.
- Supports multilingual transcription.
- Can merge overlapping lyrics for smoother transitions.
- Cleans duplicates and truncates overly long transcriptions.
- If `use_context_only=True`, skips Whisper and uses user-provided context.

### 6. **Instruction Generation**
- Creates human-readable instructions such as:
  - “Mute groups 15–16 and re-run.”
  - “Final run in progress.”
  - “All 3 runs auto-queued.”
- Sends **color-coded popups** to ComfyUI UI:
  - 🔴 **Red** – Action required / cancel & reconfigure  
  - 🟡 **Yellow** – Progress reminder  
  - 🟢 **Green** – Final run complete  
  - 🔵 **Blue / Info** – Normal updates

# 🧩 Notes

- **HuMo Frame Sync**: Frames per scene are automatically rounded up for HuMo compatibility.  
- **Auto Versioning**: If new audio differs, `_v2`, `_v3`, etc. folders are created automatically.  
- **Fallback Behavior**: If Whisper fails or is disabled, fallback words (e.g., *“thinking”*, *“walking”*) are used.  
- **Language Support**: 100+ languages supported by Whisper-Large-V3.  

---

# 🧠 In Summary

`VRGDG_LoadAudioSplit_HUMO_TranscribeV3` is an all-in-one automation node that:

- Splits, transcribes, and manages long audio files  
- Tracks project state intelligently  
- Automatically queues runs  
- Provides clear, visual workflow feedback inside **ComfyUI**  

It’s built for **HuMo** and **VRGDG** production pipelines where multi-segment audio needs to stay perfectly synchronized across scenes and renders.
