## What the Video Builder Does

The Video Builder is a scene-by-scene video creation UI inside ComfyUI. A project can use the established LTX 2.3 engine or the separate MiniMax H3 engine. It helps you build from audio, SRT timing, lyric or dialogue timing, scene notes, prompts, images, video clips, and final stitching.

The basic idea is:

1. Create or load a project.
2. Add global audio or per-scene audio.
3. Add scenes manually, from SRT, from Prompt Creator data, or from timestamped lyrics.
4. Add scene notes, lyric notes, video notes, and optional Reference Builder data.
5. Write or generate image prompts.
6. Generate or import images.
7. Write or generate video prompts.
8. Render scene videos.
9. Stitch the final video.

The current Builder includes the guided Wizard, Storyboard Builder, reference-video modes, per-scene overrides, flexible LLM runners, post-process tools, First/Last Frame workflows, Browser AI storyboarding, integrated face repair, portable project transfer, safer timeline tools, update checking, and dedicated MiniMax H3 music-video and short-film paths.

## Current Feature Overview

The current Video Builder feature set includes:

| Feature | What it adds |
| --- | --- |
| Status banner and updater | Checks the installed commit against production `main`, reports whether it is current, conditionally installs changed Python requirements, and offers a safe fast-forward update |
| Project video engines | Keeps LTX 2.3 as the default for existing and new projects while adding a separate MiniMax H3 renderer selected in Builder Settings |
| MiniMax H3 scene modes | Adds Text-to-Video, Image-to-Video, Reference-to-Video, and Video-to-Video with global settings or locked per-scene overrides |
| MiniMax exact timing and audio | Renders on H3's required 24 FPS/frame grid, supplies the exact project or scene audio when selected, then trims every result back to the authoritative timeline range |
| MiniMax references and continuity | Sends up to nine ordered images and three ordered videos, supports exact-start and spatial continuity, adds LLM-only scene-image inspiration plus face/hair priority, and preserves the purpose/order of every renderer reference |
| MiniMax short-film authoring | Adds built-in generated audio, Reference Builder voice presets, per-scene speaker cues, Guided Film Automation, and an exact-dialogue Script Mapper |
| Flexible LLM runners | Uses Gemma Local, LM Studio, or an LLM API for prompt work, with separate local context/output limits and supported text/vision routing |
| Chained First/Last Frame | Builds one opening image plus a destination image for each scene; each destination can become the next scene's start |
| Independent First/Last Frame pairs | Gives every scene its own start and end image using four resumable passes: starts, motion plans, ends, and final two-image video prompts |
| `Build Full FLF Video` | Runs missing endpoint planning, the FLF image chain, per-scene prompts/renders, final-frame extraction, and stitching as one pipeline |
| FLF continuity controls | Adds assigned-image or extracted-render start sources, visual-context modes, transition types, endpoint guide controls, and optional opening color matching |
| Start Image Storyboard Creator | Opens a standalone Browser AI storyboard UI with project lyrics, mapped character/location references, start/end frames, batch briefs, and downloadable-result import |
| Integrated `Face Fix` | Repairs distant blurry faces in a selected rendered scene range with detection/tracking, Z-Enhanced anchors, LTX temporal processing, feathering, and color matching |
| Browser AI image mode | Sends prompts and references to Flow Nano Banana, GPT Image, or Meta AI through automated or manual browser handoff, imports results into scenes, and supports reusable reference groups plus project-wide Band Sequence batches |
| `ID-LoRA I2V` | Adds identity-LoRA video generation, character/voice reference mapping, required-LoRA controls, and quiet timeline trim mode |
| Portable projects | Adds `Branch Project`, `Export Shareable Project ZIP`, and `Import Project ZIP` with project-path rebasing on import |
| Safer timeline editing | Adds playhead splitting/rendered-scene trimming, close-gaps, recoverable delete-all-videos, delete-all-images, silent playback, audio-length clamping, exact lyric-line timing, and clearer global audio scrubbing |
| Manual timing and overlay editing | Adds five Bulk Segment input formats, tap-by-ear split timing, a saved optional video overlay layer, clip visibility/locking, alternate-take rendering, and context-menu trim/copy tools |
| Reference-preserving lyric timing | Uses pasted reference lyrics as the exact text source for existing scenes, keeps every lyric line in order, and uses acoustic timing plus vocal tails to place words at scene boundaries |
| Beat-mode transcription | Creates beat-aligned scene blocks first, then automatically runs the same reference-preserving `Transcribe Existing Scenes` process with `Replace All` |
| Beat calibration and edge snapping | Adds detected-marker warping, even-grid and auto-BPM calibration, read-only CapCut beat import, per-edge snap controls, shortcuts, and bulk Scene 3+ start snapping |
| Scene-list multi-select | Selects scenes by clicking timeline clips or by entering lists, ranges, pasted scene numbers, `all`, `odd`, or `even`, then replaces, adds, or removes them from the active selection |
| Faster media preparation | Adds numbered-folder timeline image import, `Enhance All`, FLF start/end-pair folder import, and more reliable scene/media recovery |
| Image slideshow preview | Builds a timing-accurate image-and-audio preview before expensive scene video rendering |
| Render All logs | Shows live per-scene phases, elapsed time, ETA estimates, stitch timing, and persistent JSON/text reports for full render runs |
| Stronger story planning | Preserves character descriptions, handles repeated song sections, rejects real lyric-heading changes, removes only invented trailing Story Arc sections, supports repeating location blocks, and improves responsive Storyboard layout |
| Speaking and silent projects | Adds project-wide speaking/no-lip-sync behavior, ID-LoRA dialogue planning and auto durations, per-scene silence, and silent timeline audio |
| Scene Adjust finishing | Adds color, lightness, sharpness, clarity, vignette, and fade controls with still-frame preview, per-scene render, apply-all, and reusable presets |
| Flexible project storage and memory management | Lets new projects use a custom parent folder and lets DynamicVRAM users disable automatic Builder cleanup while keeping manual `Clear Memory` available |

## Recent Builder Updates

These are the newest user-facing changes covered throughout this guide:

| Update | What changed |
| --- | --- |
| MiniMax H3 Builder integration | Projects can select MiniMax H3 and use its four scene modes, dedicated prompts and renderer, ordered image/video references, exact timeline trim, input-audio or built-in-audio paths, and H3-aware `Render All`/stitching. |
| MiniMax-H3 Turbo acceleration | Optional Turbo mode injects the selected Turbo LoRA and dedicated sampler, starts at 4 editable steps, allows experimental step values below the usual 4-step target, bypasses EasyCache by default, and restores the prior normal steps/cache preference when disabled. |
| MiniMax reference priority and editing | Reference-to-Video can use a scene image as the exact start, as LLM-only environment inspiration, as environment-plus-framing inspiration, or not at all. Exact-start scenes can limit character references to face and hair, and Storyboard `Cut frequency` creates an exact duration-aware cut plan. |
| Larger LLM runner controls | Gemma Local and LM Studio now have separate input-context and maximum-output controls. Supported vision jobs can use LM Studio or a vision-capable LLM API, while progress labels identify genuinely built-in-only work. |
| MiniMax H3 B-roll safety | Scenes marked B-roll/no-lip-sync now suppress lyric, singer, speaker, and native-voice inputs during prompt generation, remove singing directions from H3 timestamp blocks, and reapply a visual-only safety contract when rendering an existing prompt. |
| MiniMax short films | Storyboard Builder can plan Guided Film scene cards, import and validate `speaker: dialogue` scripts, map every speaker to a Reference Builder character, preserve exact dialogue, and create the real timeline only after review. |
| Project storage and memory control | Settings can choose a default folder for newly created projects and can enable or disable automatic RAM/VRAM cleanup. Existing projects and temporary ComfyUI outputs are not moved. |
| International lyric alignment and longer waits | Lyric matching preserves Unicode words such as Cyrillic instead of stripping them, and Settings can keep an individual scene render waiting from 1–24 hours before the Builder reports a timeout. |
| Reference lyrics and Story Arc reliability | `Transcribe Existing Scenes` now requires reference lyrics, preserves their exact line order, corrects held or missed boundary words, and no longer inserts pipe delimiters. Beat mode automatically transcribes its finished beat scenes. Story Arc keeps a complete valid heading structure when Gemma only appends invented trailing sections. |
| Faster scene selection and Ingredients panels | `Select Multi` now supports direct timeline clicks and typed scene lists with ranges and shortcuts. The Ingredients Reference Builder correctly mounts its Sheets, Mapping, and Locations panels. |
| Timeline and Storyboard prompt controls | `+ Segment` can end at the scrubber, Space toggles playback, `S` adds a segment, Left/Right navigate scenes, Storyboard Video Prep exposes Motion Notes inline, and all-scenes Gemma runs can fill only missing prompts or redo every visible scene. |
| Timeline recovery and migration tools | Silent projects can play and scrub without global audio, rendered MiniMax built-in-audio and ID-LoRA scenes can be trimmed at the playhead, `Delete ALL Videos` clears assignments without deleting backup files, and the Tools panel can convert populated LTX prompts into separate MiniMax prompts. |
| Render visibility and resume safety | `Render All` has a persistent live log and saved reports. Missing-only Storyboard batches preserve completed prompts and save successful partial progress if a later scene fails. |
| Storyboard Gemma request reliability | Storyboard image/video prompt requests now allow up to ten minutes per scene and translate browser fetch failures into timeout or lost-backend guidance instead of exposing Firefox's raw `NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource` message. |
| Lyric, prompt, and scene safety | Adjacent scenes can be merged without shifting the remaining timeline, exact pasted lyric units remain intact, manual prompts remain manual, Storyboard starting-shot instructions are enforced, global audio remains the final soundtrack, and undo/thumbnail handling uses less memory. |

## Installing From Main

The Video Builder is released from the repository's default `main` branch.

### New Install With ComfyUI Manager

1. Open ComfyUI.
2. Open `Manager` -> `Install Custom Nodes`.
3. Search for `vrgamedev` or paste this Git URL:

```text
https://github.com/vrgamegirl19/comfyui-vrgamedevgirl
```

4. Use the default `main` branch if Manager asks you to choose a branch.
5. Install, restart ComfyUI, then hard refresh the browser page.

The current ComfyUI Registry release is `9.1.1`. ComfyUI Manager installs a registry package rather than necessarily creating a Git checkout, so `git pull` and the Builder's Git self-updater may not work inside a Manager-installed folder. Use Manager's `Update` or reinstall action for that kind of installation.

If many VRGDG nodes appear but `VRGDG AI Video Builder UI` does not, check the installed version in Manager or the `[VRGDG]` line printed in the ComfyUI terminal during startup. A version older than `9.1.0` predates the Builder/H3 registry package, while `9.1.1` adds the configurable scene-render wait. Refresh Manager's node data, update or reinstall `comfyui-vrgamedevgirl`, restart ComfyUI, and hard refresh the browser. If Manager still offers the older package, remove only this custom-node folder and use the Git installation below until Manager refreshes its registry data.

### New Install With Git

Open a terminal in your `ComfyUI/custom_nodes` folder and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vrgamegirl19/comfyui-vrgamedevgirl.git
```

Then restart ComfyUI and hard refresh the browser page.

### If You Already Have The Nodes Installed

If you are already using another branch, stop ComfyUI first, save any open project, and back up anything important before switching.

Open a terminal in your existing `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/comfyui-vrgamedevgirl` folder and run:

```bash
git fetch origin
git switch main
git pull --ff-only origin main
```

If Git says the branch does not exist locally yet, run:

```bash
git fetch origin main:main
git switch main
```

To confirm you are on the right branch:

```bash
git branch --show-current
```

It should show:

```bash
main
```

If you download from GitHub instead of using Git, download the default `main` branch as a ZIP.

After installing or switching branches, restart ComfyUI and hard refresh the browser page so the new JavaScript UI files load.

## Update Status and Self-Updater

The Builder shows a version-status banner above the workspace. It checks the installed commit against production `main` and reports one of these states:

| Banner state | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Checking | The builder is checking the local checkout and remote `main` branch |
| Up to date | The installed commit matches the latest production commit |
| Update available | The checkout is behind production `main` or is on another branch |
| Could not check | Git, the remote, or the network could not be queried |

You can dismiss the current banner state. If a newer commit becomes available, the new status can appear again.

For installations created with `git clone`, use `Menu` -> `Update to Latest` to run the built-in updater. It fetches `origin/main`, switches to local `main`, and runs a fast-forward-only pull from `origin/main`. If `requirements.txt` changed between the installed and updated commits, the updater installs it with the same Python executable running ComfyUI; otherwise dependency installation is skipped. It does not run `git reset` or `git clean`, does not delete created files, and stops if local edits would conflict. For Manager package installations without Git metadata, update through ComfyUI Manager instead.

Use `Menu` -> `What's New` or the update-status details action to review the release entries that apply to your installation. Use `Menu` -> `Review Guide` to reopen this public guide. The older Prompt Creator remains available as `Prompt Creator (Legacy)` and displays a warning before leaving the current Builder workflow.

After every completed update, fully stop and restart ComfyUI, then hard refresh the browser so the updated Python, JavaScript, and any newly installed dependencies load.

## Opening the Builder

Add the node named `VRGDG AI Video Builder UI` in ComfyUI.

When the builder opens, it may show a welcome window where you can create a new project or open an existing project.

![ComfyUI Builder Node](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vrgamegirl19/comfyui-vrgamedevgirl/refs/heads/main/Workflows/LTX-2_Workflows/Video_Builder/images/ComfyUI%20Builder%20Node.png)

Short snippet:

<a href="https://github.com/vrgamegirl19/comfyui-vrgamedevgirl/blob/main/Workflows/LTX-2_Workflows/Video_Builder/images/video/Opening%20the%20Video%20Builder%20node%20and%20welcome%20window.mp4"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vrgamegirl19/comfyui-vrgamedevgirl/refs/heads/main/Workflows/LTX-2_Workflows/Video_Builder/images/video/gifs/Opening%20the%20Video%20Builder%20node%20and%20welcome%20window.gif" alt="Opening the Video Builder node and welcome window" width="820"></a>

## The Main Layout

The builder has five main areas:

| Area | What it is for |
| --- | --- |
| Top bar | Project menu, save, Prompt Creator tools, utilities, stop button, model downloads, fullscreen |
| Left panel | Scene list |
| Center preview | Selected image or video preview |
| Right panel | Scene settings, split into Scene, Image, Video, and Audio tabs |
| Bottom timeline | Timing, playback, scene blocks, inserts, notes, beat markers, and selected media tools |

The full builder screenshot at the start of this guide shows these areas together.

## Top Bar Buttons

The top bar contains project-wide tools. These are not tied to only one scene.

| Button | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `Menu` | Opens project actions such as New Project, Load Project, Prompt Creator import, batch runs, and settings |
| `Quick Save` | Saves the current project immediately |
| `Video Type` | Sets project-wide performance behavior: `Singing (music video)`, `Speaking (short film)`, or `No lip sync` |
| `Wizard` | Opens the guided Builder setup flow |
| `Storyboard Builder` | Opens the scene-card planning and Storyboard prompt workspace |
| `Reference Builder` | Opens character/location reference setup for Flux/Klein and Nano B |
| `Line Mapping` | Opens lyric/dialogue transcription, SRT import, manual timing, performer mapping, and timing correction tools |
| `LLM Runner` | Chooses whether text-only LLM/Gemma calls use the built-in runner, LM Studio, or an API endpoint |
| `Agent` | Opens the Builder Agent chat helper |
| `Prompt Options` | Opens prompt editing, reload, clear, and prompt-file tools |
| `LLM T2I All` | Creates image prompts for multiple scenes |
| `LLM Video All` | Creates video prompts for multiple scenes |
| `Stop` | Stops the current running builder workflow |
| `Download Models` | Opens model links and model folder guidance |
| `Clear Memory` | Runs memory cleanup |
| `Fullscreen` | Expands the builder UI without closing it |
| `Close` | Closes the builder UI |

The left panel also has `Scenes`, `Tools`, and `Post Process` tabs. `Tools` contains Prompt Creator handoff, scene-note import, numbered image-folder import, `Enhance All`, Builder Agent, integrated Face Fix actions, and `Convert LTX Video Prompts to MiniMax H3`. The converter writes separate MiniMax prompts while preserving every original LTX prompt, scene time, and global-audio assignment.

The live engine badge at the right side of the top bar reads `LTX` or `MiniMax`. Check it before changing engine-specific prompts or render settings, especially after loading or branching a project.

If a button opens a modal, use that modal's `Close` button to return to the main builder.

![Top bar buttons](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vrgamegirl19/comfyui-vrgamedevgirl/refs/heads/main/Workflows/LTX-2_Workflows/Video_Builder/images/Top%20bar%20buttons%20screenshot.png)

## Starting or Loading a Project

Use the `Menu` button in the top-left area of the builder.

Important project options:

| Button | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| `New Project` | You want to start a fresh builder project |
| `Load Project` | You want to open an existing project folder |
| `Load Last Project` | You want to return to the most recent project |
| `Save Project As` | You want to duplicate the current project into a new folder |
| `Quick Save` | You want to save the current project state |
| `Auto save` | You want the builder to save changes while you work |
| `Branch Project...` | You want a named experiment copied from the current project while preserving its source relationship |
| `Export Shareable Project ZIP` | You want a portable copy that can be moved to another machine |
| `Import Project ZIP` | You want to extract, rebase, load, and continue a portable project |
| `Delete Project` | You want to permanently remove a complete project folder from the project picker; this cannot be undone |

By default, projects are saved under the ComfyUI output folder. To keep projects elsewhere, open `Menu` -> `Settings` -> `Project Storage`, choose an absolute parent folder, and click `Save Projects Root`. The preference applies to `New Project`, `Save Project As`, and `Branch Project`; it does not move existing projects or ComfyUI temporary render output. A full project path entered while creating one project overrides the preference for that project.

The project picker lists projects from the configured parent folder as well as the normal output area. For safety, the Builder does not delete projects outside the ComfyUI output folder; remove those manually only after checking the exact path. A builder project contains the session JSON, SRT, generated images, scene videos, prompt files, reference images, and copied audio assets.

## Branching, Exporting, and Importing Projects

The Builder provides three different ways to protect or move a project:

| Action | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| `Save Project As` | Make a normal full copy and immediately continue in the copy |
| `Branch Project...` | Create a named experimental branch of the current project with branch metadata, useful for alternate prompts, models, edits, or story directions |
| `Export Shareable Project ZIP` | Save the current session and download a portable archive containing the project assets |
| `Import Project ZIP` | Upload an exported archive, extract it safely into the ComfyUI output area, rebase saved project media paths, and load it |

Large ZIP exports and imports can take several minutes. Keep ComfyUI running until the browser download or import progress window finishes. Imported projects are opened as their own project folder; they do not overwrite the currently loaded source project.

To branch a project:

1. Quick Save the current source project.
2. Choose `Menu` -> `Branch Project...`.
3. Enter a descriptive branch name and create it.
4. Confirm the Builder opens/identifies the new branch before changing prompts or models.

To move a project:

1. Quick Save, then choose `Export Shareable Project ZIP`.
2. Wait for the archive to finish and keep it intact.
3. On the destination ComfyUI, choose `Import Project ZIP` and select that archive.
4. Wait while the Builder extracts the project and rewrites saved media paths.
5. Confirm the audio, scene images, references, and videos open before continuing.

## Adding Audio and SRT Timing

There are two audio styles:

| Audio style | Best for |
| --- | --- |
| Global Audio | Music videos, songs, visualizers, lyric-timed projects |
| Scene Audio | Dialogue, short films, ads, or projects where each scene has its own audio clip |

For a music video, start with global audio.

To add global audio:

1. Open the `Audio` tab on the right.
2. Use the `Timeline Audio` section.
3. Drag audio into the drop zone or use `Choose Global Audio`.

To use SRT timing:

1. Use `Choose SRT` / `Load SRT` if available in the project flow.
2. Or import timing from Prompt Creator.
3. Check the timeline to make sure scenes line up with the audio.

Supported audio formats include WAV, MP3, FLAC, M4A, and OGG.

The `Audio Tab` section later in this guide shows the audio controls.

## Working With Scenes

Scenes are the main building blocks of the video. Each scene has timing, notes, image settings, video settings, and optional audio.

Use the left scene list to select a scene. The selected scene appears in the center preview and its settings appear on the right.

Common scene actions:

| Action | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Add a new scene | Timeline `+ Segment` |
| Add an insert/overlay | Turn on `Overlay Track`, then use timeline `+ Overlay Track` |
| Delete selected scene | Timeline `x` button |
| Merge adjacent scenes | Right-click a base scene and choose `Merge with left` or `Merge with right` |
| Edit scene name | Right panel `Scene` tab, `Scene label` |
| Edit timing | Right panel `Scene` tab, `Start` and `End` |
| Prevent timing changes from SRT import | `Freeze SRT timing` |

## Using the Timeline

The timeline is at the bottom of the builder. It shows the global timing of the project, the playhead, scene blocks, notes, waveform, inserts, selected media tools, and beat markers.

Timeline controls:

| Control | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `Bulk Segments` / `Bulk` | Create many manual scenes using fixed lengths, song-fit timing, pasted durations, exact ranges, or timestamp markers |
| `+ Scene Note` | Show editable note boxes below scenes |
| `+ Video Note` | Show editable video-motion/performance notes below scenes |
| `+ Line Note` / hide line notes | Show or hide editable line, lyric, or dialogue boxes under the base scenes |
| `Set In` / `Set Out` | Mark a selected range using the playhead |
| `Clear Range` | Remove the selected range |
| `Close Gaps` | Shift later base scenes left to remove empty timeline gaps |
| `Snap Scene Edge` | Move the selected scene start or end to the closest beat while moving only a directly connected neighbor's shared boundary |
| Scissors (`✂`) | Split an unrendered base scene, or trim a rendered ID-LoRA/MiniMax built-in-audio scene before or after the playhead |
| `+ Timeline Note` | Add a timeline marker or note |
| `+ Segment` | Add a normal scene; when the scrubber is at least 0.5 seconds beyond the final base scene, it becomes the new segment endpoint |
| `Overlay Track: On/Off` | Enable or ignore the saved overlay layer during preview and stitching |
| `+ Overlay Track` | Add an overlay clip at the playhead without changing the base timeline |
| Undo / Redo | Revert or restore timeline edits |
| Play / Stop | Preview audio/timeline playback; when no playable audio exists, advance the timeline with the silent clock |
| `Select Multi` | Open the scene-selection chooser, then select clips directly or enter a scene-number list |
| Waveform size | Choose small, medium, or large waveform |
| `Snap beats` | Snap edits to detected beats |
| Zoom `-` / `+` | Zoom the timeline view |
| `Use Frame as Image` | Save the current video frame as the selected scene image |
| `Delete Image/Video` | Remove selected media from the scene |
| `Delete ALL Videos` | Clear every scene's selected/generated video, video history, thumbnail assignment, trim state, and rendered continuity assignment without deleting the actual video/thumbnail files from the project folder |
| `Delete ALL Images` | Clear first frames, FLF end frames, and extracted chained start frames from every scene and delete those files from the current project |
| `Delete ALL segments` | Delete every base and overlay segment after confirmation; use only when intentionally rebuilding the complete timeline |

The Builder treats loaded global audio as the hard timeline boundary. Scenes and overlays beyond the audio end are removed, clips crossing the end are trimmed, new scenes cannot extend past it, and the timeline shows both timeline and audio duration. The scrubber is labeled `Global audio scrub` so it is clear that it follows the soundtrack rather than the selected video.

If a project has no global audio, Play still advances the playhead, selects the current scene, and supports seeking/scrubbing through the saved scene duration. A rendered MiniMax built-in-audio clip can supply local scene playback sound; otherwise the Builder uses a silent timeline clock. Closing the Builder stops global audio, scene audio, silent playback, and video-preview playback.

When using the scissors button on an unrendered scene, move the playhead inside the selected scene and away from either edge. Vocal text remains on the left half; instrumental text is retained on both halves. For a rendered ID-LoRA or MiniMax built-in-audio scene, click or right-click the scissors and choose whether to remove everything before or after the playhead. Use the quiet trim mode when you need to scrub for a clean sound boundary without autoplay.

`Delete ALL Videos` is recoverable at the file level: it clears timeline assignments and histories but leaves rendered videos and thumbnails in the project folder as backups. `Delete ALL Images` is intentionally different and removes the managed image files described in its confirmation dialog.

Right-click a base scene to merge it with its left or right neighbor. The merge keeps the outer start/end times, combines lyrics, notes, singers, and scene mappings, and does not shift the scenes that follow it.

### Bulk Manual Segments

`Bulk` opens `Bulk Manual Segments`, which creates many base scenes without repeatedly clicking `+ Segment`.

| Input format | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `Fixed length + scene count` | Creates a chosen number of consecutive scenes with one shared duration |
| `Fit to song duration` | Fills the loaded audio duration using a preferred scene length; a final remainder at least half that length is kept, while a smaller remainder is added to the previous scene |
| `Durations` | Accepts one duration per line in seconds, `mm:ss`, or `hh:mm:ss` |
| `Start - End rows` | Accepts absolute ranges such as `0 - 4` or `00:04.00 - 00:08.50` |
| `Timestamp markers` | Creates scenes between each neighboring marker; for example, `0`, `4`, and `8.5` create two scenes |

`Replace current base timeline` rebuilds the base scenes; saved overlay clips remain on the overlay track. `Append after last scene` is available for fixed-length and duration-based input. Exact ranges, markers, and `Fit to song duration` replace the base timeline because their times are absolute or cover the entire song. Review the preview count and final end time before clicking `Apply Bulk Segments`.

### Overlay Track

The Overlay Track is an optional video-only layer for alternate takes, B-roll, or covering part of a base clip.

- Turn `Overlay Track` on before using `+ Overlay Track`. When the track is off, overlay clips stay saved but are ignored during playback and final stitching.
- An enabled overlay is visible wherever it covers a base scene. Empty areas or hidden overlays show the base video underneath.
- The eye icon enables or hides one overlay without deleting it.
- New overlay clips are locked by default. Unlock one before moving or trimming it, then lock it again to protect the timing.
- Enabled overlay clips cannot overlap each other. With `Snap beats` on, moving and trimming use beat snapping.
- The base timeline remains the audio source; overlays replace visible video only.
- Right-click a base scene and choose `Copy as insert track` to make an overlay copy with the scene's prompts, mappings, references, and settings. When regenerating an existing scene video, `Add to overlay track` keeps the original base take and places the new take above it.

Right-click timeline items for additional editing commands. Base scenes provide video restore, merge-left/right, copy-to-overlay, close-gaps, scene options, and delete actions. ID-LoRA base videos and unlocked overlay videos also provide trim-left/right at the playhead or clicked point. Right-click a Director Note to copy it into a free Timeline Note, delete it, or open Scene Options. In Scene Audio mode, right-click a custom-audio waveform to `Cut audio here`; cuts too close to either edge are rejected.

`Select Multi` supports two selection styles:

- Turn multi-select on and click any base scene or insert to toggle it.
- Enter base-scene numbers separated by commas, spaces, or new lines. Ranges such as `4-8`, pasted lists, and the shortcuts `all`, `odd`, and `even` are accepted.
- Choose whether the entered list replaces the current selection, adds to it, or removes from it.
- Selected clips turn red. Reopen `Select Multi` to revise the list or exit multi-select and return to normal single-scene editing.

Timeline keyboard shortcuts work when the cursor is not inside a text field or dialog:

| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Space` | Play or pause the timeline |
| `S` | Add a segment |
| `Left Arrow` / `Right Arrow` | Select the previous or next scene |
| `Ctrl+S` / `Ctrl+E` | Snap the selected scene start or end to the nearest beat |

When `S` or `+ Segment` uses the scrubber as the final endpoint, beat snapping is honored when enabled and the Builder asks for confirmation before creating an unusually long scene.

### Beat Calibration and Scene Snapping

Open `Tools` -> `Beat Calibration...` when automatically detected markers have the right rhythm but the wrong offset or gradually drift away from the song.

| Grid type | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `Warp detected markers` | Capture the first, middle, and last real beats; the Builder warps the detected markers across those anchors to correct offset and cumulative drift |
| `Even BPM grid` | Uses three captured anchors to build a corrected evenly spaced test grid |
| `Auto-detect BPM + chosen start` | Analyzes the audio BPM, then generates an even grid from one exact starting beat |
| `Import exact CapCut markers` | Reads the newest local CapCut project whose audio duration matches, using frame-aligned timeline markers or its AI beat cache without modifying CapCut files |

You can capture with the playhead or enter a CapCut-style `HH:MM:SS:FF` / `HH:MM:SS+FF` timecode and FPS. Calibration changes beat markers only; it does not move scene timing.

After calibration:

- `Snap Scene Edge` moves the selected start or end to its closest marker. If a neighboring scene touches that boundary, only the shared edge follows.
- `Ctrl+S` snaps the selected scene start and `Ctrl+E` snaps its end when you are not typing in a field.
- `Snap Scene 3+ Starts to Beats` aligns Scene 3 and every later base-scene start while leaving the Scene 1-to-2 boundary fixed.

Timeline lanes:

| Lane | What it is for |
| --- | --- |
| `Base` | The main scene timeline. These clips define the normal order of the final video |
| `Inserts` | Extra insert clips that sit above the base timeline |
| `Director Notes` / Scene Notes | Image/scene direction notes, often used by image prompting |
| `Video Notes` | Motion, camera, acting, and performance notes for video prompting |
| `Lyric Notes` | Lyrics/vocal line for each scene, used by Gemma for I2V/T2V prompting |
| Waveform | Visual display of the audio |

Use `Video Notes` when you want to describe what should happen in motion. Use `Director Notes` or image notes for the still image idea. Use `Lyric Notes` for the exact lyric or vocal line.

## Scene Tab

The `Scene` tab stores the general information for the selected scene.

Main fields:

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `Scene label` | Name of the scene |
| `Freeze SRT timing` | Keeps this scene timing from being changed by timing imports |
| `Start` / `End` | Scene start and end time |
| `Prompt JSON path` | Concept prompt JSON to import scene ideas |
| `I2V motion notes JSON path` | Motion notes to import for video prompting |
| `Use VRGDG text context files` | Use the default/global text context files |
| `Global theme/style text file` | Overall style, look, and mood reference |
| `Global story idea text file` | Overall story/concept reference |
| `Global subject/scene text file` | Character, subject, and scene reference |

Use this tab first when a scene needs better direction before image or video generation.

How to use it:

1. Select a scene in the left scene list or timeline.
2. Give it a useful `Scene label`.
3. Check `Start` and `End`; enable `Freeze SRT timing` before later timing imports if those times must not move.
4. Type or import the scene's concept/director notes. Use the JSON path fields when Prompt Creator or another tool produced saved prompt files.
5. Enable the VRGDG context files you want Gemma to read, and confirm the global theme, story, and subject files point to the correct project material.
6. Save the project, then continue to `Image` for the still image and `Video` for motion.

Changing Scene-tab context does not automatically replace an existing generated prompt. Run the appropriate Gemma prompt button again, or edit the saved prompt manually, when you want the change reflected in new media.

![Scene Tab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vrgamegirl19/comfyui-vrgamedevgirl/refs/heads/main/Workflows/LTX-2_Workflows/Video_Builder/images/Scene%20Tab.png)

## Image Tab

The `Image` tab creates or manages the selected scene image. Pick the image model at the top of the tab.

Image modes:

| Mode | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| `ZImage` | Main local image generation workflow |
| `Flux Klein` | Flux/Klein image generation, including reference image ingredients |
| `Nano B` | NanoBanana image generation with optional reference images and API key |
| `Ernie` | Ernie Image generation |
| `Krea 2` | Two-pass Krea image generation with optional LoRAs and image-to-image input |
| `Browser AI` | Browser-assisted image generation with Flow Nano Banana, GPT Image, or Meta AI, including prompt/reference handoff and result import |
| `Enhance` | Upscale or enhance a selected image |
| `+ Custom` | Load your own image for the scene |

Each image mode usually has three subtabs:

| Subtab | What it controls |
| --- | --- |
| `Models` | Model files, VAE/CLIP, Gemma models, LoRAs |
| `Image Settings` | Size, seed, batch size, image-to-image, reference images, trigger phrase |
| `LLM Prompting` | Notes, Gemma prompt generation, and the final image prompt |

Basic image workflow:

1. Select a scene.
2. Open `Image`.
3. Pick an image mode, usually `ZImage` for a first test.
4. Add notes in `LLM Prompting`.
5. Click `Gemma T2I` to create a prompt, or type your own prompt.
6. Click the create button for that model, such as `Create Z-Image`.
7. Review the image in the center preview.

### ZImage

`ZImage` is the local text-to-image workflow. It can use a standard text prompt, optional LoRAs, and optional image/reference prompting depending on the current settings.

Common ZImage controls:

| Control | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `ZImage model` | Diffusion model file |
| `CLIP` | Text encoder file |
| `VAE` | VAE file |
| `Non-Vision text Gemma model` | Gemma model used for text-only prompt creation |
| `Vision Gemma model` / `Vision mmproj` | Used when Gemma needs to look at an image reference |
| `Use LoRAs?` | Enables LoRA settings |
| `LoRA count` | Number of LoRAs to show/use |
| `Pass 1` / `Pass 2` strengths | LoRA strength for each pass when the workflow supports two-pass generation |
| `Gemma T2I` | Generates the text-to-image prompt |
| `Create Z-Image` | Runs the ZImage image workflow |

To create a ZImage:

1. Select the scene and choose `Image` -> `ZImage`.
2. In `Models`, choose the diffusion model, CLIP, VAE, and Gemma files. Enable and configure LoRAs only if needed.
3. In `Image Settings`, choose the size, seed, batch count, and any image-to-image/reference source.
4. In `LLM Prompting`, write the desired subject, location, composition, lighting, and style in the notes.
5. Click `Gemma T2I`, review the generated prompt, and edit it if necessary.
6. Click `Create Z-Image`.
7. Review the result and its image history; select the version you want the Video tab to use.

### Flux/Klein

`Flux Klein` supports image ingredients and Reference Builder images.

Use Flux/Klein when you want:

- a character reference plus a location reference
- multiple image ingredients
- a global subject reference used across every scene
- scene-specific images such as props, backgrounds, or style references

Common Flux/Klein controls:

| Control | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `Image trigger phrase` | Optional phrase added to the start of prompts |
| `Use global image ingredients` | Adds global image references to every scene |
| `Image ingredients` drop area | Scene-specific images for character, background, props, or style |
| `Upload Images` | Opens file picker for image ingredients |
| `Clear Images` | Removes loaded image ingredients |
| `Gemma Flux Prompt` | Uses Gemma vision/text to create a Flux/Klein prompt |
| `Create with Flux/Klein` | Runs the Flux/Klein image workflow |

If Reference Builder is enabled, Flux/Klein can automatically include the mapped subject and location images for each scene.

To create a Flux/Klein image:

1. Save the project and map reusable subjects/locations in `Reference Builder`, or prepare scene-specific image ingredients.
2. Select the scene and choose `Image` -> `Flux Klein`.
3. Pick the Flux/Klein models and set the output size and seed.
4. Enable global ingredients when every scene should receive the same references.
5. Drop scene-only character, location, prop, or style images into `Image ingredients`.
6. Write image direction and an optional trigger phrase.
7. Click `Gemma Flux Prompt` and verify that the prompt assigns the correct role to every reference.
8. Click `Create with Flux/Klein`, then choose the preferred result from image history.

### Nano B

`Nano B` is the NanoBanana image mode. It uses an API key and can use reference images. It can also receive Reference Builder subject/location references.

Common Nano B controls:

| Control | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `API key` | NanoBanana/Google API key used by the hidden workflow |
| `Model` | NanoBanana model choice |
| `NanoBanana reference images` | Drop or upload reference images for the scene |
| `Global reference images` | Shared references used across scenes when enabled |
| `Gemma NB Prompt` | Creates a NanoBanana prompt from notes and references |
| `Create with NanoBanana` | Runs the NanoBanana image workflow |

Nano B prompts do not need strict section headers. If Gemma creates a normal usable image prompt, Nano B can still run.

Nano B works best when its prompt clearly says the reference images are identity/location references, not images to paste into the output. If the output looks like a character was dropped into the reference location, rewrite the prompt with stronger camera language such as `close-up`, `upper body`, `low angle`, `profile`, or `new camera position`.

To create a Nano B image:

1. Choose `Image` -> `Nano B`.
2. In `Models`, enter the API key and choose the NanoBanana model.
3. Set image size/seed and decide whether global references should be included.
4. Drop scene-specific references into the NanoBanana reference area, or use saved Reference Builder mappings.
5. Add clear scene and camera direction in `LLM Prompting`.
6. Click `Gemma NB Prompt` and confirm that identities and locations are described as references rather than pasted compositions.
7. Click `Create with NanoBanana`.
8. If the composition copies the reference too closely, change the camera/framing instruction and generate again.

### Ernie

`Ernie` is another image-generation mode. It works similarly to ZImage from the UI side: choose models, set image settings, optionally use Gemma, then create the image.

Use Ernie when you want to compare a scene image against ZImage, Flux/Klein, or Nano B.

To create an Ernie image:

1. Select a scene and choose `Image` -> `Ernie`.
2. Choose the Ernie model files and output settings.
3. Optionally click `Load I2I Image` for image-to-image generation or `Load Reference Image` for vision-guided prompt writing.
4. Add scene direction in Ernie's `LLM Prompting` area.
5. Click `Gemma T2I`, then review or edit the Ernie prompt.
6. Click `Create with Ernie`.
7. Compare the new result with the scene's other image-history versions and select the one to keep.

### Krea 2

`Krea 2` is a two-pass image mode. It has its own model picks, optional LoRAs, image-to-image controls, prompt trigger phrase, and per-scene override toggle.

Use Krea 2 when you want:

- a polished alternate image pass for the same scene prompt
- separate LoRA strengths for the first and second image pass
- image-to-image testing from a loaded reference image
- a scene-specific image model setup without changing global ZImage, Ernie, Flux/Klein, or Nano B settings

Common Krea 2 controls:

| Control | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `Use custom Krea 2 settings for this scene` | Lets the selected scene override global Krea 2 model and generation settings |
| `Krea 2 Models` | Sets the Krea workflow model files |
| `Use LoRAs?` | Enables Krea 2 LoRA rows |
| `Pass 1` / `Pass 2` strengths | Controls LoRA influence in each generation pass |
| `Load I2I Image` | Loads a source image for image-to-image generation |
| `Gemma T2I` | Creates a Krea 2 image prompt |
| `Create with Krea 2` | Runs the Krea 2 image workflow |

To create a Krea 2 image:

1. Choose `Image` -> `Krea 2`.
2. Select the Krea model files and configure the two generation passes.
3. Enable LoRAs if needed and set separate pass 1/pass 2 strengths.
4. Optionally enable the selected scene's custom Krea settings or load an I2I source image.
5. Write the scene direction, click `Gemma T2I`, and review the prompt.
6. Click `Create with Krea 2`.
7. Review the result before enabling scene-specific overrides elsewhere; an override affects only the selected scene.

### Enhance

`Enhance` works on an existing selected image. Use it to upscale, enhance, or perform image-to-image improvement.

The LLM Prompting tab in Enhance can use the selected/custom image as context to create a better enhancement prompt.

To enhance an image:

1. Select a scene that already has an image, and make sure the desired version is selected in image history.
2. Choose `Image` -> `Enhance`.
3. Set the enhancement/upscale model and the desired output settings.
4. Add instructions describing what should improve and what must remain unchanged.
5. Click `Gemma Enhance Prompt`, review the dedicated Enhance prompt, and click `Upscale / Enhance Image`.
6. Compare the result with the source. The original remains available in image history, so select it again if the enhancement is worse.

Use `Send to Enhance` beside another image mode's prompt when you want that prompt copied into the Enhance workflow. Use `Enhance All` only after testing the settings successfully on one representative scene.

### Load Custom

`+ Custom` / `Load Custom` lets you use your own image for the selected scene instead of generating one.

Use this for:

- images created outside ComfyUI
- screenshots
- previous workflow outputs
- manually curated scene images

The loaded image becomes the selected scene image, so video generation can use it the same way it uses generated images.

To use a custom image:

1. Select the destination scene.
2. Choose `Image` -> `+ Custom` / `Load Custom`.
3. Select the PNG, JPEG, or WebP image and wait for it to appear in the preview/history.
4. Confirm it is the selected image before creating an I2V or FLF video.

## Browser AI Image Mode

`Browser AI` lets the builder use supported browser image services while keeping the scene prompt, references, mappings, and imported result attached to the project.

Available providers are:

| Provider | Typical use |
| --- | --- |
| `Flow Nano Banana` | Google Flow/Nano Banana image generation and reference work |
| `GPT Image` | ChatGPT image generation and editing |
| `Meta AI` | Meta AI browser image generation |

![Browser AI provider models and setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vrgamegirl19/comfyui-vrgamedevgirl/refs/heads/main/Workflows/LTX-2_Workflows/Video_Builder/images/BrowserAI/image-browserAI-models.png)

Basic setup:

1. Open `Image` -> `Browser AI`.
2. Click `Install Browser Automation` once, then `Check Browser Setup`.
3. Use `Open Selected Login`, sign in to the provider in the opened browser, and leave that browser profile available.
4. Create or edit the scene prompt with `Gemma Browser Prompt`.
5. Choose which scene, character, location, previous-scene, or other supported references should be sent.
6. Click `Create with Browser AI` and wait for the generated download to be imported.

If automated control is unavailable, use `Open Manual Browser`, `Export Scene Refs`, and `Import Latest Download`. The manual path exports the same project references for you, lets you generate in the browser yourself, then imports the newest provider download as the scene image.

![Browser AI manual mode](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vrgamegirl19/comfyui-vrgamedevgirl/refs/heads/main/Workflows/LTX-2_Workflows/Video_Builder/images/BrowserAI/image-browserAI-manualMode.png)

Browser AI also participates in FLF endpoint generation. In independent mode it can receive a scene start image plus supported character/location ingredients while generating the matching end frame.

### Browser AI Setup and Failure Controls

The `Setup`, `LLM Prompting`, `Groups`, and `Manual` tabs separate browser configuration from scene generation.

| Control | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Provider buttons | Switch between Flow Nano Banana, GPT Image, and Meta AI while retaining provider-specific browser profiles |
| Aspect ratio | Chooses `16:9`, `9:16`, `1:1`, `4:3`, `3:4`, or `21:9`; Flow's own UI must also be set to one image and the desired aspect ratio |
| Timeout / retries | Controls how long the Builder waits and how many times an automated request may be retried |
| After final failure | Uses the last successful image, tries another supported provider first, or stops |
| `Send previous scene's FLF end frame as context` | Adds the prior FLF endpoint as visual continuity guidance |
| `Edit Browser T2I Instructions` | Edits the instructions used when Gemma writes Browser AI prompts |
| `Manual Mode` / `Auto-advance after import` | Keeps browser generation under manual control and can move to the next scene after the latest download is imported |

### Reusable Reference Groups

The `Groups` tab is project-wide and is not limited to the currently selected scene. Use custom groups when you want to prepare reusable casts or subject combinations:

1. Turn `Band Sequence mode` off.
2. Use `New Group`, `Duplicate`, `Rename`, or `Delete` to organize combinations of people or characters.
3. Drop any number of character/band images into the selected group or use `Add Group Images`.
4. Add one location with `Choose Location`. A group may also be sent without a location.
5. Edit the generation prompt and click `Send Selected Group`.
6. Enable `Auto-select next group/set after sending` to prepare the next group without submitting it automatically.

`Clear Group Images`, `Clear Location`, and group deletion remove the references from the saved group but leave the stored image files intact.

### Band Sequence Mode

`Band Sequence mode` builds a repeatable set of Browser AI requests across every supplied location. Add:

- one or more singer reference images
- optional non-band `Extras`
- all `Other Band Members`
- every location reference that should be used

For each location, the Builder prepares these subject sets in order:

1. `Singer only`
2. `Singer + Extras`, when extras were added
3. `Other band members only`
4. `Full band with singer`

The current location and current subject-set selectors let you jump to any combination. The generated prompt updates its exact character count, requests five separate 16:9 music-video stills, prevents unrequested people, and tells the provider not to return a grid. `Auto-select next group/set after sending` advances through the sets and then through the locations, but it never sends the next request until you click `Send Selected Set`.

Band Sequence can retain up to 49 singer/extra/member reference images and up to 200 saved locations. Requests reuse the selected provider tab so you can review and download each result before continuing.

When sending a group or Band Sequence set, the Builder can temporarily route downloads into the current project under `Browser AI Images`, grouped by reference set and location. Click `Finish Session + Restore Downloads` when finished so the controlled browser returns to its normal download folder.

### Fill Timeline Images From Folder and Enhance All

Open the left `Tools` tab for two useful batch actions:

| Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `Fill Timeline Images From Folder` | Imports numbered PNG/JPEG/WebP files into existing base scenes in numeric order. If the folder contains matching `scene_0001.png` and `scene_0001_end.png` files, the Builder can import them as independent FLF start/end pairs and disable chaining |
| `Enhance All` | Runs the current Enhance workflow for every timeline scene that already has an image, using that scene's current image prompt |

The numbered-folder tool requires a saved project, global audio, and existing scenes unless the import flow explicitly offers to create the scene slots.

### Prompt Sharing Across Image Models

When Gemma creates a T2I prompt for a scene, the builder can copy that prompt into the matching prompt boxes for the other image models. This makes it easier to try ZImage, Flux/Klein, Nano B, Ernie, or Enhance without asking Gemma to rewrite the same scene every time.

You can still edit each model's prompt after it is copied.

Generate the prompt in your preferred image mode, switch to a second image mode, and review its populated prompt before rendering. Changes made afterward to only one model's prompt remain model-specific, so copy/regenerate again when every backend should receive the revision.

### Image Trigger Phrase

The image trigger phrase is added at the start of image prompts when it is filled in.

Use it for model-specific trigger words, LoRA trigger phrases, or a short global style phrase. Leave it blank if the model does not need one.

Fill the trigger phrase before running the model's Gemma prompt action. Confirm it appears once at the beginning of the final prompt. It is not a replacement for mapped Reference Builder trigger phrases, and changing it does not rewrite already generated prompts until you regenerate or edit them.

### Per-Scene Image Settings

The Builder lets a single scene override the global settings for each supported image mode.

Use the `Use custom ... settings for this scene` toggles when one scene needs a different model, seed, LoRA, image-to-image source, reference setup, resolution, or trigger phrase. Multi-select can apply many of these model/settings changes to several selected scenes at once.

If the toggle is off, the scene follows the global settings for that image mode again.

To make a scene override:

1. Select the scene and image mode.
2. Enable `Use custom ... settings for this scene`.
3. Change only that scene's model, seed, LoRA, resolution, I2I, trigger, or reference fields.
4. Generate the scene and compare it with a global-settings scene.
5. Disable the toggle when you want that scene to inherit global settings again.

## Video Tab

The `Video` tab creates the selected scene video. The controls depend on the project engine selected in Settings. In an LTX project, choose between:

| Mode | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `Image to Video` | Uses the selected scene image plus a video prompt |
| `ID-LoRA I2V` | Uses a required identity LoRA plus mapped character and optional per-character voice references |
| `Text to Video` | Uses a text prompt directly, without requiring a scene image |
| `Reference to Video` | Uses LTX/MSR reference images and text prompting for the selected scene |
| `Ingredients to Video` | Uses a mapped Ingredients sheet image and the required Ingredients LoRA |
| `First Last Frame` | Guides LTX from a scene start image to a scene end image, either as a continuous chain or independent start/end pairs |
| `Import Custom Video` | Reserved for a future direct-import panel; use scene video restore/history tools for now |

The LTX Video tab has three subtabs:

| Subtab | What it controls |
| --- | --- |
| `Models` | LTX/video model files, audio VAE, Gemma models, video LoRAs |
| `Video Settings` | FPS, width, height, seed, warm up frames, cool down frames |
| `LLM Prompting` | Motion notes, Gemma I2V/T2V prompt generation, final video prompt |

Basic Image-to-Video workflow:

1. Create or load an image for the scene.
2. Open `Video`.
3. Choose `Image to Video`.
4. In `LLM Prompting`, write motion notes.
5. Keep `Use image reference for I2V prompt?` checked if you want Gemma to look at the scene image.
6. Click `Gemma I2V`.
7. Review or edit the `Video prompt`.
8. Click `Create Scene Video`.

Basic Text-to-Video workflow:

1. Open `Video`.
2. Choose `Text to Video`.
3. Write motion notes or a full video prompt.
4. Optionally use a reference image for Gemma prompt writing.
5. Click `Create Scene Video`.

### Image To Video

`Image to Video` uses the selected scene image as the first-frame visual source. This is the normal workflow after creating scene images.

Important controls:

| Control | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `Use image reference for I2V prompt?` | Gemma looks at the scene image while writing the video prompt |
| `I2V motion notes` | User notes for camera movement, acting, motion, and performance |
| `Gemma I2V` | Creates the image-to-video prompt |
| `I2V prompt` | Final prompt sent to the video workflow |
| `Create Scene Video` | Renders the selected scene video |

If Lyric Mapping has been saved, Gemma can use the lyric line, singer choices, instrumental flag, and B-roll/no-lip-sync flag while writing the I2V prompt.

### Text To Video

`Text to Video` creates video without requiring a scene image.

Use it when:

- you want to skip image generation
- you are building from text prompts only
- you are making quick motion tests
- you want a scene generated directly from concept and video notes

For T2V, Gemma uses the concept/image prompt, video notes, lyric notes, singer mapping, and user motion notes to create the video prompt.

Use T2V when image generation is not needed, or when you want the video model to invent the first frame from text.

To create a T2V scene:

1. Select the scene and choose `Video` -> `Text to Video`.
2. Set the video model, resolution, FPS, seed, and optional LoRAs.
3. Write the subject, action, camera movement, setting, and timing in the video notes.
4. Click the T2V/Gemma prompt button, or type the complete video prompt yourself.
5. Check that the prompt does not depend on an image that T2V will not receive.
6. Click `Create Scene Video`, review the clip, and select the desired video-history version.

### Reference To Video

`Reference to Video` is the LTX/MSR reference-video mode. It is useful when the scene should be driven by a mapped subject reference rather than only a generated scene image.

Use it when:

- the same character identity must stay consistent across scenes
- you have MSR subject references in Reference Builder
- you want Storyboard Builder prompts to describe motion while references carry identity
- you are making a lyric-driven video where singer mapping and subject mapping matter

Important controls:

| Control | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `Required MSR LoRA` | Required LoRA for Reference-to-Video |
| `MSR strength` | Strength for the MSR reference-video LoRA |
| `Gemma Reference Video` | Writes the reference-video prompt for the selected scene |
| `Reference Builder` | Opens the MSR reference/mapping setup when this mode is active |

Reference-to-Video works best after saving lyric/singer mapping and Reference Builder subject mapping.

To create a Reference-to-Video scene:

1. Save the project, then open `Reference Builder`.
2. Add subject references and descriptions, map the correct subject to the scene, and save.
3. Save lyric/singer mapping when the subject sings or speaks.
4. Choose `Video` -> `Reference to Video`.
5. Confirm the required MSR LoRA/model and strength, and verify the selected scene shows the expected mapped reference.
6. Add motion/performance notes or prepare the scene in Storyboard Builder.
7. Click `Gemma Reference Video`, review the prompt and trigger phrasing, then click `Create Scene Video`.
8. If the wrong identity appears, correct the scene mapping rather than compensating only in prompt text.

### Ingredients To Video

`Ingredients to Video` uses complete Ingredients sheet images mapped to scenes. Each scene can receive its own Ingredients sheet from the Ingredients Reference Builder.

Use it when:

- you have a prepared reference sheet for a character, pose, outfit, scene, or location
- you want a reference sheet to act as the scene's visual source
- you want lyric review and scene mapping to decide which sheet belongs to which moment

Important controls:

| Control | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `Required Ingredients LoRA` | Required LoRA applied for Ingredients-to-Video |
| `Pass 1` | Strength for the required Ingredients LoRA on the first pass |
| Width/height | Defaults to the Ingredients training-friendly resolution, with a warning when needed |
| `Gemma Ingredients Video` | Writes the Ingredients-to-Video prompt |
| `Ingredients Reference Builder` | Uploads, describes, and maps Ingredients sheets to scenes |

The Ingredients LoRA was trained around `768x448`. Other sizes can work, but unusual aspect ratios may reduce composition quality.

To create an Ingredients-to-Video scene:

1. Prepare a complete Ingredients sheet for each character/look you need.
2. Open `Ingredients Reference Builder`, upload and describe the sheets, map them to scenes, and save.
3. Choose `Video` -> `Ingredients to Video`.
4. Confirm the required Ingredients LoRA is present and set its first-pass strength.
5. Keep the recommended `768x448` resolution for the first test.
6. Add scene motion notes and click `Gemma Ingredients Video`.
7. Check that the correct sheet is shown for the scene, then click `Create Scene Video`.
8. If a batch uses the wrong sheet, fix the scene mapping before running `LLM Video All` or `Render All` again.

## MiniMax H3 Video Engine

MiniMax H3 is a separate project video engine inside Video Builder. Open `Menu` -> `Settings` -> `Project Video Engine` and choose `MiniMax H3`. This changes the Video tab, prompt preparation, scene renderer, batch renderer, timing adapter, and final stitch for the whole project. It does not convert or rewrite an LTX project automatically; existing projects and projects without an engine value continue to use LTX.

Start a new project or use `Save Project As`/`Branch Project` before changing engines when you want to preserve an established LTX version.

### MiniMax Scene Modes

The MiniMax Video tab provides four modes:

| Mode | Inputs and typical use |
| --- | --- |
| `Text to Video` | Prompt plus the selected audio path; no image or video reference is required |
| `Image to Video` | Uses the selected scene image as the visual starting input |
| `Reference to Video` | Uses ordered Reference Builder images and can optionally make the selected scene image the exact first frame |
| `Video to Video` | Uses up to three ordered source videos, their trim ranges and purposes, plus optional ordered edit images |

Mode, models, resolution, audio mode, timing handles, sampler, EasyCache, SageAttention, and FP16 accumulation are project-wide by default. Enable the scene's custom MiniMax settings lock when one scene needs a different mode or render setup. The lock copies the current effective settings into that scene; while it is off, later global changes continue to flow into the scene.

### Models and Render Settings

MiniMax H3 currently uses the standard diffusion model loader. GGUF diffusion models are filtered out and are not supported by this Builder path. The default model names are:

```text
models/diffusion_models/minimax_h3_ref2va_pruned_int8_convrot.safetensors
models/text_encoders/qwen3vl_32b_minimax_h3_nvfp4_awq.safetensors
models/vae/minimax_h3_video_vae_fp16.safetensors
models/vae/minimax_h3_audio_vae_fp32.safetensors
```

The main video settings choose aspect ratio, megapixels, seed, warm-up frames, and cool-down frames. The collapsed advanced area contains sampler, scheduler, steps, denoise, EasyCache controls, SageAttention, and FP16 accumulation. Begin with the workflow defaults and test a single scene before changing advanced controls.

#### MiniMax-H3 Turbo Acceleration

Enable `Use MiniMax-H3 Turbo LoRA (4-step)` when the optional `ComfyUI-MiniMax-H3-Turbo` extension and selected Turbo LoRA are installed. The Builder injects the Turbo LoRA and dedicated Turbo sampler into a queued copy of the hidden workflow; standard MiniMax rendering is unchanged while Turbo is off.

When Turbo turns on, the Builder defaults to 4 editable steps and enables `Bypass EasyCache`. The step field remains editable down to 1 for quality/speed experiments, though values below 4 are outside the Turbo LoRA's usual 4-step target. Turning Turbo off restores the normal step count and EasyCache preference that were active before Turbo was enabled. Existing projects saved with the former 20-step Turbo default migrate to the newer 4-step default when appropriate.

The default Turbo LoRA filename is:

```text
models/loras/minimax_h3_turbo_4step_ema_ckpt850.safetensors
```

If the extension, its nodes, or the selected LoRA is missing, the render stops with an installation/file message instead of silently falling back to standard sampling. Restart ComfyUI after installing or updating the extension.

The Builder's compatibility adapter supports the current Turbo v1.2.2 forward-patch API as well as the earlier AdaLN wrapper API. This is required when the default pruned Ref2VA model uses Turbo together with character reference audio. If an older Builder reports `Missing helpers: _AdalnDelta` even though the Turbo extension is current, update `comfyui-vrgamedevgirl` to registry version `9.1.0` or newer, then restart ComfyUI.

MiniMax timing rules are different from LTX:

- H3 renders at a fixed `24 FPS`.
- Frame counts are rounded up to H3's required `17n+5` grid.
- The Builder renders enough context to cover the scene, then trims the result back to the exact timeline start/end duration.
- Warm-up and cool-down frames provide context; they do not lengthen the finished scene.
- One H3 scene is limited to about 15 seconds. Split longer dialogue or music ranges into smaller scenes.

### MiniMax Audio Modes

| Audio mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `Input Audio (exact supplied audio)` | Uses custom scene audio when present, otherwise the matching project-audio range. The source waveform is kept unchanged for timing and lip sync. |
| `Built-in MiniMax Audio` | Lets MiniMax create scene audio from the prompt. This enables native character voice presets and Short Film speaker assignments. |

Use Input Audio for a finished song, narration, or dialogue recording that must remain exact. The Builder trims/pads the source into H3's audio latent for generation and uses the original audio in the finished timeline; it does not ask H3 to rewrite the words.

Use Built-in MiniMax Audio for a short film where H3 should create the voices and sound. In `Reference Builder`, each mapped character can receive a MiniMax built-in voice preset or a custom preset name and description. In a Short Film scene, use `Speaker Assignment` to order exact dialogue cues. Speaker Assignment is intentionally disabled for Input Audio because changing the typed words would no longer match the supplied recording.

For built-in-audio scenes, use the quiet timeline trim mode to set clean boundaries without automatic preview playback. Review the embedded sound of every scene before the final stitch.

### Ordered Image References

Reference-to-Video can use up to nine image inputs. Open the scene's MiniMax reference chooser from the Video tab and order the Reference Builder images exactly as H3 should receive them. Until you save a custom choice, the scene automatically follows its mapped character and location references.

`Scene image use` controls the role of the selected timeline image:

| Choice | LLM behavior | MiniMax renderer behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Do not use scene image` | Does not inspect it | Does not receive it |
| `Exact start frame (LLM + MiniMax)` | Uses it as visual truth while writing the prompt | Receives it as Image 1 and the exact opening frame |
| `Environment inspiration only (LLM only — ignore framing)` | May use location, atmosphere, lighting, materials, background objects, and scene activity; must ignore composition and all character details | Never receives it and no reference slot is consumed |
| `Environment + framing inspiration (LLM only)` | May also use optional shot distance, angle, lens, framing, and composition; must still ignore every character's identity, appearance, clothing, pose, placement, and activity | Never receives it and no reference slot is consumed |

Prompt-only inspiration is not named `Image 1` in the final MiniMax prompt. Renderer reference numbering begins with the first image MiniMax actually receives.

When `Exact start frame` is active, `Character reference influence` chooses how character sheets interact with that frame:

| Choice | Priority contract |
| --- | --- |
| `Face + hair only (keep the rest of the start frame)` | Character references may replace only face identity and hair. The start frame remains authoritative for body, proportions, clothing, pose, composition, lighting, environment, and every other visible detail. |
| `Full character identity (face, hair, clothing, and body)` | Character references may guide the full character appearance while the start image still defines the opening composition. |

These controls apply to all eligible unlocked Reference-to-Video scenes. If the active scene has custom MiniMax settings locked, they apply only to that scene. Regenerate existing MiniMax prompts after changing either control.

Important rules:

- `Exact start frame (LLM + MiniMax)` reserves Image 1 for the selected scene image.
- Previous-scene continuity can reserve one additional image slot, leaving fewer library-reference slots.
- `Previous final frame — spatial reference` supplies the previous render as another visual reference.
- `Previous final frame — exact start frame` makes the previous render's last frame the new scene's exact start.
- A scene image exact start and previous-frame exact start cannot both own the same exact-start position.

The numbered order is significant. Save the scene after rearranging references, then inspect the summary count before rendering.

### Video-to-Video References

Video-to-Video accepts up to three ordered source videos. Each row stores:

| Field | What it controls |
| --- | --- |
| Video path | Source clip sent to H3 |
| Start and duration | Portion of the source clip to use |
| Purpose | `Continuation / Extension`, `Movement Guide`, `Camera Guide`, `Edit / Rhythm Guide`, `Transformation Source`, or `Visual Style Guide` |
| Use audio | Whether that reference video's audio is available to the workflow |

`Use Current Scene Video as Reference 1` quickly assigns the selected scene's current video. Reference Builder edit images may be sent alongside the videos in their saved order. Check source trim ranges and purposes carefully; the adapter preserves them rather than flattening every video into the same kind of reference.

### MiniMax Prompting

MiniMax prompts are stored separately from LTX video prompts, so generating or editing an H3 prompt does not overwrite an LTX prompt for the same scene. Click `Create MiniMax H3 Prompt` to use the runner selected in `LLM Runner`. Each H3 mode has its own editable instruction set.

The left `Tools` panel also provides `Convert LTX Video Prompts to MiniMax H3`. It sends every populated LTX video prompt through the selected LLM Runner and saves the result into the separate MiniMax prompt field. It does not alter the original LTX prompt, scene timing, global Audio 1 file, or other project data. The converter is intended for music-video projects that are being branched or migrated to MiniMax; it does not switch the project to Built-in MiniMax Audio.

The prompt writer receives the exact scene duration, timeline/audio contract, lyric or dialogue line, mapped performers, ordered image/video references, and the current H3 mode. Review that the prompt:

- describes action that fits within the exact scene time
- names references in their displayed order
- uses `<Audio 1>` when the supplied audio drives the performance
- preserves the exact lyric/dialogue instead of paraphrasing it
- includes saved voice descriptions only for Built-in Audio speakers

`Cut frequency` appears in MiniMax Storyboard Scene Defaults and ranges from 0–10. A value of 0 requires one continuous take with no cuts. Higher values calculate an exact duration-aware schedule; 10 requests approximately one continuity-preserving `CUT TO` per second. When cuts are active, the prompt writer must use the exact calculated count/times and must not add extra cuts, dissolves, or unrelated scene changes.

Rendering uses the complete saved right-panel MiniMax prompt as written. `Render All` does not silently rewrite the stored voice, B-roll, timestamp, or continuity sections. Regenerate or edit the prompt before rendering when its contract needs to change.

Click `Create MiniMax H3 Scene Video` to render one scene. The Builder uses the dedicated H3 workflow and adds the exact-trimmed result to that scene's video history.

### MiniMax Short Film and Script Mapper

For generated dialogue, set the top-bar `Video Type` to `Speaking (short film)`, select `Built-in MiniMax Audio`, create and save characters/voices in Reference Builder, then open Storyboard Builder. The Short Film Story Layer offers:

| Authoring path | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `Guided Film Automation` | Uses the selected LLM to develop editable scene cards from a premise, outline, saved characters/locations, or an authoritative imported script |
| `Fully Custom` | Leaves scene-card authoring and speaker cues under manual control |
| `Import Script / Script Mapper` | Parses `.txt` or `.json`, validates every `speaker: dialogue` cue, maps speakers to saved characters, estimates timing, and splits long cues into H3-safe scenes |

Script Mapper activation does not change the Video Builder timeline. In Guided Film, first activate and review the exact script, then develop the storyboard scenes. The LLM may add visual actions, reactions, shots, camera direction, location, ambience, and continuity, but it may not rewrite, reorder, merge, or omit the authoritative dialogue. After reviewing the cards and speaker assignments, click `Create Timeline Segments` to replace/create the real Builder scenes.

### Rendering and Stitching MiniMax Projects

`Render All` detects the project engine and routes MiniMax scenes through the H3 workflow. It respects each scene's effective global or locked mode, validates required prompts/references/audio, renders only the requested missing/new versions, trims every clip to its exact timeline duration, and stitches the H3 results.

The current MiniMax path does not apply LTX-only canvas, mode, embedded-audio, or Post Process workflow settings. Use H3's own resolution and audio controls. Test one representative scene before a batch, especially after changing models, EasyCache, reference order, audio mode, or continuity.

## ID-LoRA Image-to-Video

`ID-LoRA I2V` is for identity-driven LTX video. The required ID-LoRA occupies the first LoRA slot, while optional video LoRAs are added after it.

Use `ID-LoRA Ref Builder` inside Reference Builder to:

- map saved characters to scenes
- attach character reference images and descriptions
- attach a voice sample to each character when the workflow needs reference audio
- map a character and location to each scene
- enter the exact dialogue for each scene
- automatically estimate and ripple scene durations from dialogue, or turn auto duration off and enter a manual duration

The Video tab provides required ID-LoRA pass strengths, identity scale, a fallback voice sample, and ID-LoRA-specific Gemma instructions. The fallback voice is used only when the selected character does not have its own mapped voice sample.

`Trim Mode` above the timeline is an ID-LoRA helper for quietly scrubbing and finding trim points without automatic playback.

To create an ID-LoRA scene:

1. Choose `Video` -> `ID-LoRA I2V`.
2. Open `ID-LoRA Ref Builder`, add each character's identity reference and description, and optionally attach a clean voice sample.
3. Map the correct character to each scene and save.
4. Confirm the required ID-LoRA occupies the required first slot; add optional style/video LoRAs after it.
5. Set identity scale, pass strengths, and the fallback voice only if some mapped characters have no voice sample.
6. Create/select the scene's starting image, add motion and performance notes, and run the ID-LoRA Gemma prompt.
7. Review the prompt and create the scene video.
8. Use `Trim Mode` when selecting quiet trim points, then select the preferred result from video history.

### Speaking and ID-LoRA Dialogue Projects

Set the top-bar `Video Type` to `Speaking (short film)` for dialogue rather than singing. Line Mapping then treats performer choices as speakers, and prompt preparation uses the exact dialogue with speaking wording while keeping unlisted visible characters as silent reactors. It explicitly avoids singing, rapping, lyric, vocal, and music-performance language. Use `No lip sync` for visual-only scenes where nobody should say or sing the saved line.

For an ID-LoRA short film, `Storyboard Builder` provides `Plan Dialogue Scenes` in the Story Layer. Enter a premise, outline, or pasted script and choose a scene count from 1–24; if the story fields are blank, Gemma can invent a plan from the saved ID-LoRA characters and locations. Review the preview scene cards, then click `Apply Dialogue Plan`. Applying the plan creates speaking-mode Builder scenes, writes the dialogue into Line Notes and the ID-LoRA scene map, carries character/location casting, and calculates initial scene duration from each line. It replaces the blank starter scene automatically; if a real timeline already exists, the Builder asks before replacing the base scenes and clearing overlays.

## First Last Frame Video

`First Last Frame` (FLF) guides a scene between two real images. The Builder supports two different structures:

| FLF structure | How it works |
| --- | --- |
| `Chained — previous end becomes next start` | Creates one opening image and one destination per scene. Scene 1's end becomes Scene 2's start, and the chain continues through the build |
| `Independent pairs — every scene owns a start + end` | Every scene keeps a separate start and end. No endpoint is reused by another scene |

### Chained FLF

Chained mode is designed for continuous visual handoffs. Use `Image All` -> `Resume FLF Image Chain` to create or resume one opening image plus the missing destination images. A redo choice can regenerate the chain while keeping the saved prompts.

For rendering Scene 2 onward, choose the actual chained start source:

| Start source | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Previous scene's assigned end image | Uses the planned endpoint exactly |
| Previous rendered video's extracted final frame | Uses what the preceding render actually produced |

Optional opening color matching samples the previous video's actual final frame, matches the beginning of the next clip, and fades the correction out over the chosen duration. This is a post-process continuity aid; it does not alter the previous clip or use the extracted frame as an extra LTX guide.

### Independent FLF Pairs

Independent mode uses a locked, resumable four-pass order:

1. Finish or keep all selected scene start images.
2. Let Gemma inspect every start image and create a provisional motion/end plan.
3. Create every end image from its own start, motion plan, mapped character/location descriptions, and supported references.
4. Let Gemma inspect each actual start/end pair and write the final FLF video prompt that connects those exact images.

Use `Image All` -> `Build Independent Start + End Pairs` for the safe resume path. `Redo Independent Motion Plans + Ends` keeps starts but rebuilds later stages; `Redo ALL Independent Starts + Ends` rebuilds all four passes.

For one scene, use the endpoint panel in the Video tab:

| Control | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Endpoint mode | Choose an automatic ending or enter a custom ending direction |
| `Create Motion Plan` | Builds the provisional movement and destination plan from the start image |
| `Create End Frame` | Generates the end image with the active image model |
| `Create Final FLF Prompt` | Rewrites the video prompt after viewing the actual start and end images |
| `Load End Frame` | Uses your own destination image |
| `Clear End Frame` | Removes the saved destination from the selected scene |

When adjacent scenes reuse a mapped location, the Builder uses the previous start as a do-not-copy composition reference and directs the next scene toward a different believable camera position or area inside that location.

### FLF Prompt and Guide Settings

`Gemma visual context` controls how much non-image context Gemma receives while designing the transition:

- `Images + story beat` is the recommended balance.
- `Images only` makes the real endpoints the visual truth while still adding the exact lyric/speaking line and selected facial-performance direction afterward.
- `Full scene context` sends the larger scene context.

You can also set the global transition type, CRF, blur, resize/crop behavior, guide frame indexes, latent-guide strength, attention strength, and other advanced LTX guide settings. `Restore Workflow Defaults` returns these controls to the values stored in the hidden workflow.

### Build Full FLF Video

`Build Full FLF Video` runs the complete dependency chain:

1. Fill missing FLF endpoint story beats.
2. Create or resume the optimized image chain.
3. Create each vision video prompt at the correct render step and render the missing clips.
4. Extract final frames where needed and stitch the finished video.

Choose `Resume missing` first when continuing a project. The other choices can redo images and videos or redo videos only. This button requires `First Last Frame` mode; use normal `Build Full Video` for the other video modes.

### Video Notes

Video Notes are separate from image/scene notes. Use them for motion-specific instructions such as:

- camera movement
- character movement
- performance energy
- lip-sync direction
- environmental motion
- action beats

Example:

```text
Slow side dolly as the singer leans against the door frame, hair moving slightly in the wind.
```

### I2V Prompt Enhancement Pass

`I2V prompt enhancement pass` is an optional extra Gemma cleanup pass for video prompts.

When enabled, the builder creates the first video prompt, then asks Gemma to clean it into a stronger video-ready structure.

Use it when:

| Situation | Why |
| --- | --- |
| Prompts feel too loose | The pass makes them more structured |
| Lyrics are not being handled clearly | The pass can reinforce singer/lyric behavior |
| Multiple singers are confusing Gemma | The pass can keep all listed singers active |
| Instrumental/B-roll scenes mention singing | The pass can remove singing/no-vocal wording |

Leave it off if you prefer to manually write or preserve the exact prompt.

### Seeds And Custom Scene Settings

The global video settings apply to all scenes by default.

Turn on custom scene settings when a specific scene needs different:

- model files
- LoRAs
- LoRA strengths
- trigger phrase
- FPS
- seed
- width/height
- warm up frames
- cool down frames

Use this for one-off scenes, special LoRA tests, or different video resolutions.

To override one scene safely:

1. Select the scene and note the current global values.
2. Enable the scene-specific/custom video settings toggle.
3. Change only the fields that must differ.
4. Use a new seed for a different variation or keep the old seed to compare one setting change.
5. Render only that scene first.
6. Turn the override off if the scene should return to global settings; changing global settings does not necessarily replace an enabled scene override.

### Video LoRAs

Video LoRAs can use separate strengths for pass 1 and pass 2 when the hidden workflow supports it.

| Setting | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| `Use video LoRAs?` | Enables video LoRA selection |
| `Video LoRA count` | How many LoRA rows are visible |
| `Pass 1` | Strength used during the first video pass |
| `Pass 2` | Strength used during the second video pass |

Use a lower pass 1 strength when a LoRA hurts motion. For example, some style LoRAs trained on images work better at `0.5` on pass 1 and `1.0` on pass 2.

### Warm Up And Cool Down Frames

Warm up and cool down frames help the hidden video workflow create smoother scene clips.

| Field | What it is for |
| --- | --- |
| `Warm Up Frames` | Gives the workflow extra lead-in frames before the final trimmed section |
| `Cool Down Frames` | Gives the workflow extra frames after the final trimmed section |

If a scene starts too stiffly, check that warm up frames are enabled and set to a useful number.

Start with the hidden workflow defaults. Increase warm-up frames when the usable action begins too abruptly, and increase cool-down frames when motion is cut off at the end. Re-render one scene after each change because these extra frames increase processing time and may affect the final trim.

![Video Prompting](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vrgamegirl19/comfyui-vrgamedevgirl/refs/heads/main/Workflows/LTX-2_Workflows/Video_Builder/images/Video%20Prompting.png)

## Audio Tab

The `Audio` tab controls audio for the selected scene and the overall timeline.

Sections:

| Section | What it is for |
| --- | --- |
| `Scene Audio` | Add or manage audio attached to the selected scene |
| `Timeline Audio` | Add or manage the global project audio |

Use `Scene Audio` for scene-specific dialogue or clips. Use `Timeline Audio` for music-video timing.

To use global timeline audio:

1. Open `Audio` -> `Timeline Audio`.
2. Choose the global/timeline audio source and drop or load the song.
3. Wait for the duration/waveform to update.
4. Create or import scenes/SRT within that audio duration.
5. Use the global scrubber to preview timing; use its speaker button to mute timeline audio when previewing a finished video that already contains sound.
6. Save the project so the copied audio path and timeline state persist.

To use per-scene audio:

1. Select the scene and open `Audio` -> `Scene Audio`.
2. Click `Open Scene Audio Options`.
3. Load the dialogue, narration, or short scene clip and choose the applicable scene-audio behavior.
4. Preview that scene and confirm the audio length fits its timeline range.
5. Repeat only for scenes that require their own audio.

Do not mix global music and scene audio accidentally. Pick the source style that matches the project, and use silent-audio duration when intentionally building without an audio file.

For a project with no soundtrack, choose `No audio / silent timeline`, enter `Silent duration seconds`, and click `Create Silent Audio`. The Builder creates a silent WAV in the project folder and loads it as timeline audio so scene timing and final rendering still have a defined duration. For one silent scene in a scene-audio project, open that scene's audio options, enter its duration, and click `Use Silence For This Scene`.

When a project has global audio, that track remains the preferred final soundtrack during scene-audio preparation and stitching. Scenes without custom audio are filled from the matching global-audio range. Loading or restoring global audio also restores timeline playback and the visible waveform.

![Audio Tab](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vrgamegirl19/comfyui-vrgamedevgirl/refs/heads/main/Workflows/LTX-2_Workflows/Video_Builder/images/Audio%20Tab%20Timeline%20Audio.png)

## Line Mapping

The `Line Mapping` button opens the tools used to connect audio, lyrics or dialogue, scene timing, performers, and no-lip-sync sections. Older screenshots and parts of this guide may call it Lyric Mapping; the saved `Line Note` field supports either sung lyrics or spoken dialogue.

Use Lyric Mapping when you want Gemma to know:

| Question | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| What lyric is happening in each scene? | Gemma can include the correct vocal line in video prompts |
| Who is singing? | Duets and multi-character scenes can keep the right person lip-syncing |
| Is this scene instrumental? | Gemma can avoid creating singing or mouth movement |
| Is this scene B-roll? | A person can appear on screen without lip-syncing |
| Are the scene timings correct? | LTX receives better audio and prompt timing |

Lyric Mapping has two main jobs:

1. Put lyric notes onto the timeline.
2. Review and correct those notes before creating video prompts.

The usual flow is:

1. Load the project audio in the `Audio` tab.
2. Open `Lyric Mapping`.
3. Choose whether you already have timeline scenes.
4. Transcribe lyrics or create scenes from lyrics.
5. Open `Review Lines + Map Performers`.
6. Correct lyrics, timing, singers, instrumental sections, B-roll, and locations.
7. Save the lyric mapping.
8. Run Gemma video prompting.

![Lyric Mapping Step 1 window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vrgamegirl19/comfyui-vrgamedevgirl/refs/heads/main/Workflows/LTX-2_Workflows/Video_Builder/images/Lyric%20Mapping%20Step%201%20window.png)

### Step 1: Transcribe Lyrics Or Create Scenes

The first Line Mapping screen has three transcription/import choices plus a separate Manual Timing tab.

| Option | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| `Option 1: Existing scenes` | You already have timeline scenes and want to fill lyric notes into them |
| `Option 2: Create scenes from lyrics` | You do not have timeline scenes yet and want the builder to create scenes from the song |
| `Option 3: Import SRT file` | You already have subtitle timing and want scenes plus Line Notes created directly from it |
| `Manual Timing` | You want to listen and tap the scene boundaries yourself |

### Option 1: Existing Scenes

Use `Transcribe Existing Scenes` when your timeline already has scene blocks.

This keeps the current scene timing and sends the global audio, the existing scene windows, and the required reference lyrics to the transcription workflow. Reference lyrics are the authoritative text source: every supplied lyric line must be returned in the same order, while acoustic word timing decides which existing scene receives each word. If that coverage check fails, the current timeline is left unchanged instead of silently dropping lyrics.

Use `Replace All` when rerunning transcription after correcting the reference lyrics or timing. The output uses normal spaces—never pipe delimiters—and only writes `[instrumental]` when no reference lyric belongs in that scene. Held final words can follow their detected vocal tail across a cut, while an unrecognized first or last word stays beside recognized words from the same lyric line instead of stretching across silence.

Use this when:

| Situation | Why |
| --- | --- |
| You imported scenes from Prompt Creator | The scene timing already exists |
| You manually created scenes | You want lyrics attached to those existing timings |
| You adjusted timing by hand | You do not want the transcriber to replace the whole timeline |

After it finishes, open `Review Lines + Map Performers` to listen through the boundary scenes and make any final timing correction.

### Option 2: Create Scenes From Lyrics

Use `Create Scenes From Lyrics` when you do not have scenes yet.

This option listens to the loaded audio, uses optional reference lyrics, and creates timeline scene blocks from the detected lyric timing.

Before using Option 2:

1. Open the `Audio` tab.
2. Load the song or voice track as timeline/global audio.
3. Return to `Lyric Mapping`.
4. Click `Create Scenes From Lyrics`.

The Create Scenes window includes these controls:

| Control | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `Reference lyrics` | Paste the real lyrics. They are required for existing-scene transcription and Beat mode and strongly recommended for every lyric-driven mode |
| `Language` | The language Whisper should use, such as `english` |
| `Segment mode` | Controls how reference lyrics become timeline scenes |
| `Include instrumental gaps` | Adds no-vocal scenes for long gaps between vocal sections |
| `Instrumental text` | Text used for no-vocal scenes, usually `[instrumental]` |
| `Min gap seconds` | Minimum no-vocal gap length before the builder creates an instrumental scene |
| `Min scene seconds` | Prevents very tiny scene blocks |
| `Max scene seconds` | Prevents one lyric or instrumental section from becoming too long |
| `Vocal tail padding` | Adds a little extra time after vocal chunks so last words are less likely to get cut off |
| `Create Timeline Scenes` | Runs the timestamped transcription workflow and replaces the current base timeline with generated lyric scenes |
| `?` hint | Explains the timestamped lyric settings |

![Create Scenes From Lyrics window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vrgamegirl19/comfyui-vrgamedevgirl/refs/heads/main/Workflows/LTX-2_Workflows/Video_Builder/images/Create%20Scenes%20From%20Lyrics%20window.png)

Important notes:

- Option 2 replaces the current base timeline scenes with the generated lyric scenes.
- Existing generated media is not deleted, but it may no longer line up after timing changes.
- Lyric notes use the supplied reference words, so correct the reference lyrics before running transcription.
- Blank lines in pasted lyrics are treated as spacing, not instrumental sections.
- Only `[instrumental]` and `[instrumental break]` explicitly force a no-vocal section. `[intro]`, `[outro]`, and `[break]` are song-structure headers because those sections may still contain lyrics.
- Parenthesized words are treated as sung or spoken lyric text. The Builder warns before transcription, preserves the words, and removes only the parenthesis characters from the final lyric output.

### Option 3: Import SRT File

Use `Import SRT File` when a finished SRT already contains the timing and line text you want. The Builder creates base timeline scenes from the subtitle start/end timestamps and fills the Line Notes lane with the matching subtitle text. This replaces the current base timeline, so import it before generating scene media or save/branch the project first.

### Manual Timing

Manual Timing creates scene boundaries by ear without changing the timeline until you approve the split list.

1. Load the project audio and open `Line Mapping` -> `Manual Timing`.
2. Play the audio. Press `Down Arrow` or click `Add Split At Playhead` at each desired scene boundary.
3. Use `Undo Last Split` or `Clear Splits` to correct the preview list.
4. Set `Minimum scene length`; split points too close to another marker or the audio edge are rejected.
5. Click `Create Scenes From Splits` to replace the base timeline with the previewed scenes. Existing overlays are cleared by this operation.

Manual Timing creates timing only. Run `Transcribe Existing Scenes`, import an SRT, or edit Line Notes afterward when the scenes also need lyrics/dialogue.

### Segment Mode

`Segment mode` controls how the lyric text is divided before timing is created.

| Mode | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| One scene per lyric line | Each lyric line becomes its own scene target |
| Reference chunks / grouped lines | Larger lyric chunks can become longer scenes |
| Exact reference lyric lines | Every non-empty pasted lyric line becomes exactly one vocal scene with that exact text and without min/max duration rewriting |
| One scene per stanza | Keeps each pasted stanza together as one scene target |
| Beat mode | Creates beat-aligned segments first, then automatically runs the same reference-preserving `Transcribe Existing Scenes` process with `Replace All` |
| Whisper chunks | Uses Whisper's detected chunks more directly |

For most music-video projects, start with one scene per lyric line. It is easier to review and fix.

Use `Exact reference lyric lines` when the pasted lyric lines are already the units you want. Vocal lines are not split, merged, stretched, or constrained by the scene-duration fields. Instrumental gaps can still be included as complete gaps and split manually later with the timeline scissors.

Lyric matching is Unicode-aware. Cyrillic and other non-Latin words are retained during stable-ts alignment instead of being reduced to empty lines. If an older project created incorrect two-second scenes from `0:00`, update/restart the Builder and run the reference-lyric transcription again with `Replace All`.

Beat mode is a two-stage operation handled by one button: it creates the beat scene blocks, saves those blocks as the current timeline, and then fills them through `Transcribe Existing Scenes`. You do not need to run transcription a second time afterward. The Wizard uses the same shared scene-creation and lyric-mapping engines as Line Mapping, so the same reference-preservation rules apply there.

### Include Instrumental Gaps

When `Include instrumental gaps` is on, the builder creates scene blocks for no-vocal areas.

Use this for:

| Song section | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Intro with music but no singing | Creates an instrumental scene |
| Break between verses | Creates an instrumental or no-vocal scene |
| Outro after vocals end | Creates an instrumental scene |

This helps prevent Gemma from making the character sing during parts of the song where nobody should be singing.

### Min Gap Seconds

`Min gap seconds` decides how long a no-vocal gap must be before it becomes its own scene.

Example:

| Value | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `1.0` | Creates more instrumental gaps, including shorter pauses |
| `2.0` | Good default for music videos |
| `4.0` | Only longer no-vocal sections become separate scenes |

If you get too many tiny instrumental scenes, increase this value. If instrumental sections are being missed, lower it.

### Min And Max Scene Seconds

`Min scene seconds` prevents scenes that are too short to be useful.

`Max scene seconds` prevents a lyric or instrumental section from stretching too long.

If a lyric line is being stretched across a long intro or break, lower `Max scene seconds` and keep `Include instrumental gaps` enabled.

### Vocal Tail Padding

`Vocal tail padding` adds a little extra time after a vocal phrase. This is useful when the last word of a line feels like it is spilling into the next scene.

Use small values first:

| Value | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `0` | No extra tail |
| `0.25` | Small safety buffer |
| `0.5` | More forgiving for held words |
| `1.0` | Large buffer, but may push into the next section |

Padding helps, but it does not replace manual review. Always check the timing in `Review Lines + Map Performers`.

## Review Lines And Map Performers

`Open Review + Performer Mapping` is the main cleanup window after transcription.

This is where you listen scene by scene, fix lyric text, correct timing, choose singers, mark instrumental/B-roll scenes, and save the data that Gemma uses for video prompting.

![Review Lyrics and Map Singers window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vrgamegirl19/comfyui-vrgamedevgirl/refs/heads/main/Workflows/LTX-2_Workflows/Video_Builder/images/Review%20Lyrics%20%20Map%20Singers%20window.png)

### Top Controls

| Control | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `?` | Opens the help window for this review screen |
| `Close` | Closes the review window without applying unsaved edits |
| `Single character singer label` | The natural label Gemma/LTX should use for a one-character project |
| `Timing edit mode` | Controls how timing changes affect neighboring scenes |
| Audio player | Plays the project audio for review |
| `Prev` | Moves to the previous scene |
| `Play Selected Scene` | Plays the currently selected scene |
| `Next` | Moves to the next scene |
| `Save Lines + Timing + Performers + Locations` | Applies the reviewed lines, timing, performer/speaker choices, and locations to the real timeline |

`Optional: Full Text Auto-Mapper` opens the advanced Line Mapper. Paste clean lyrics or dialogue, use `Split Into Lines`, and assign one or more saved Reference Builder subjects as performers/speakers for each full line. It supports explicit instrumental/B-roll rows and speaker prefixes such as `[Sarah]` or `[Sarah + Daniel]`. `Save Mapper` keeps the mapping, while `Apply To Timeline` matches those mapped lines to the current transcribed Line Notes.

### Single Character Singer Label

Use this when the project has one character.

Instead of forcing Gemma to say `Character 1`, type a natural label such as:

- `the woman`
- `the man`
- `the singer`
- `the lead vocalist`

This label is used in video prompts, so choose wording that sounds natural in a prompt.

### Timing Edit Mode

Timing edit mode controls what happens when you change a scene's start or end time.

| Mode | What it does | Best for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Lock rest of timeline` | Moves only the shared boundary between neighboring scenes. Later scenes keep their timing | Fixing one boundary without shifting the whole project |
| `Ripple following scenes` | Moves following scenes when you change timing | Large timing edits where everything after the edit should shift |

For lyric cleanup, `Lock rest of timeline` is usually safest.

### Scene Rows

Each scene row contains the tools for one scene.

| Control | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Scene name/time display | Shows scene number, start time, end time, and duration |
| `Start` | Editable start time for the scene |
| `End` | Editable end time for the scene |
| `Set Start` | Sets the scene start to the current audio playhead time |
| `Set End` | Sets the scene end to the current audio playhead time |
| `Split At Playhead` | Splits the scene into two scenes at the current audio playhead |
| Lyric text box | The lyric or vocal text Gemma will read for that scene |
| Singer checkboxes | Choose who should visibly sing or lip-sync this scene |
| `All` next to a singer | Applies that singer choice across scenes |
| `Group / all visible singers` | Tells Gemma all visible singers should perform together |
| `Location` | Connects the scene to a Reference Builder location |
| `Instrumental` | Marks the scene as no sung lyrics |
| `B-roll / no lip-sync` | Allows visuals/people, but tells Gemma nobody should lip-sync |
| `Play Scene` | Plays only this scene's audio range |
| `Play From Here` | Starts playback at this scene and continues forward |
| `Select` | Selects this scene in the main builder timeline |

### Start, End, Set Start, And Set End

Use the `Start` and `End` boxes when you know the exact time.

Use `Set Start` and `Set End` when listening:

1. Play the audio.
2. Pause where the scene should start or end.
3. Click `Set Start` or `Set End`.

This is useful when the last word of a lyric is getting cut off, or when a scene starts too early.

### Split At Playhead

`Split At Playhead` cuts the selected scene into two scenes at the current audio playhead.

Use it when:

| Problem | Why split helps |
| --- | --- |
| One scene contains two lyric lines | Each lyric can get its own scene |
| A vocal line is followed by an instrumental section | Split the vocal and no-vocal parts |
| A long scene needs more visual variety | Split it into smaller scenes |

The split copies useful scene data into both new pieces, including lyric text, singer settings, B-roll/instrumental state, motion notes, and location mapping. Review both new scenes after splitting.

### Lyric Text Box

This text is what Gemma sees as the vocal line for that scene.

You can type plain lyrics:

```text
I feel the air changing
```

You can also write call-and-response or duet notes:

```text
Male: "I feel the air changing" Female: "Something close, something far"
```

If you do not type quotes, the builder can add quotes around the vocal line when it builds the video prompt.

### Singer Choices

Singer choices tell Gemma who should visibly sing.

| Choice | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| One character checked | Only that character should sing or lip-sync |
| Multiple characters checked | All checked characters should sing together |
| `Group / all visible singers` | Everyone visible in the shot may sing |
| No singer checked | Gemma may treat the visible subject as the singer unless the scene is instrumental or B-roll |

For duets, make sure both singers are checked on the duet lines. Otherwise Gemma may make one person sing while the other only reacts.

### The All Button

The `All` button applies a singer choice across the project.

Use it when one character appears or sings in most scenes.

Be careful with `All` in duets or multi-character projects, because it can assign a singer more broadly than intended.

### Location Dropdown

The `Location` dropdown connects a scene to a Reference Builder location.

This only has options after you create locations in Reference Builder.

Use it when:

| Goal | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Keep a scene in a specific place | Gemma and supported image modes can use that mapped location |
| Use a location reference image | The scene can receive that location reference |
| Keep story continuity | Scenes can stay in the same location across lyrics |

Leave it `Unassigned` if you do not want a mapped location reference.

### Instrumental

Use `Instrumental` when nobody is singing in that scene.

This should be used for:

- intros
- outros
- musical breaks
- instrumental solos
- no-vocal sections

When a scene is marked instrumental, Gemma should avoid singing, lip-syncing, or mouth movement instructions.

### B-roll / No Lip-sync

Use `B-roll / no lip-sync` when the scene can show people, movement, or story visuals, but nobody should mouth the words.

Examples:

| Scene idea | Use B-roll? |
| --- | --- |
| Character walking through a hallway during vocals | Yes, if they should not sing |
| Close-up of hands, props, or environment | Yes |
| Singer performing the lyric | No |
| Instrumental intro with a character preparing on stage | Yes or Instrumental |

B-roll is different from Instrumental. Instrumental means no sung lyric exists in that section. B-roll means a lyric may exist, but the visible shot should not lip-sync it.

### Play Scene And Play From Here

`Play Scene` plays the current scene range only.

`Play From Here` starts at that scene and keeps playing forward. This is useful when you need to find the exact place where a lyric ends, because playback does not stop at the old scene boundary.

### Save Lines + Timing + Performers + Locations

This is the most important button in the review window.

It applies the edited review rows back into the actual builder timeline.

It saves:

| Saved item | Where it goes |
| --- | --- |
| Corrected lyric text | Scene lyric notes |
| Start/end timing | Scene timing |
| Singer choices | Lyric/singer mapping |
| Instrumental and B-roll flags | Scene no-lip-sync behavior |
| Location choices | Reference Builder scene mapping |

If you close the window without saving, the review edits may not be applied to the timeline.

### How Gemma Uses Lyric Mapping

After saving, Gemma uses this information when creating I2V or T2V prompts.

| Saved data | How Gemma uses it |
| --- | --- |
| Lyric text | Adds the exact vocal line when needed |
| Singer choice | Makes the correct person sing |
| Multiple singers | Keeps duet/group singing together |
| Instrumental | Avoids singing and lip-sync instructions |
| B-roll/no lip-sync | Allows visual action without mouth movement |
| Location | Helps keep the scene tied to the mapped location |

This is why reviewing lyrics before running Gemma can improve lip-sync, reduce wrong singers, and prevent characters from singing during instrumental sections.

## Reference Builder

The `Reference Builder` button opens the `Reference Image Builder`. This is for projects where scenes need consistent characters, locations, or visual references across many generated images or videos.

Reference Builder can feed references into `Flux/Klein` or `Nano B`, depending on the current image mode. It also supports the LTX video-side reference flows and the ordered image/video/voice data used by MiniMax H3.

Use it when:

| Goal | What to use |
| --- | --- |
| Keep the same character across scenes | `Character References` |
| Keep locations consistent | `Location References` |
| Connect scenes to specific location images | `Scene Mapping` |
| Drive LTX/MSR Reference-to-Video | `MSR References` and subject mapping |
| Drive LTX Ingredients-to-Video | `Ingredients Sheets` and scene mapping |
| Drive MiniMax Reference-to-Video | Ordered character/location/extra image references, with an optional exact scene start image |
| Drive MiniMax Video-to-Video | Up to three ordered video sources plus ordered visual-edit images |
| Give MiniMax short-film characters consistent voices | A built-in voice preset or custom preset name/description on each character |
| Include manually loaded image references too | `Also include manually loaded reference images` |

Main areas:

| Area | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `Use subject reference` | Sends the character/subject reference into supported image generations |
| `Use mapped location references` | Sends the mapped location image for each scene |
| `Character References` | Upload or generate subject reference images |
| `Extract Subjects` | Uses project prompts/director notes to find subjects |
| Character description tools | Describe or edit identity, face, hair, body, and clothing details that the Builder carries into storyboard and FLF planning |
| `Create Subject with ZImage` | Generates a subject reference image |
| `Location References` | Add, upload, or generate location reference images |
| `Extract Locations` | Uses project prompts/director notes to find locations |
| `Auto Map Locations with Gemma` | Lets Gemma choose which location reference fits each scene |
| `Scene Mapping` | Manually choose the location reference for each scene |
| `Ingredients Sheets` | Upload complete Ingredients sheet images for Ingredients-to-Video |
| `Describe Ingredients Sheets` | Uses vision Gemma to summarize sheet images for mapping/prompt context |
| `Ingredients Scene Mapping` | Chooses which sheet each scene should use |
| Bulk scene assignment | Assign characters and locations randomly, in rotation, or in repeating location blocks |
| `Save Reference Builder` | Saves the reference setup into the project |

When Reference Builder opens, choose the setup that matches the current generation path:

| Setup | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| `I2V / T2V Text Mapping` | Character/location names and descriptions for Gemma prompting without sending reference images |
| `Flux / Nano Image References` | Character and location images for supported still-image generation |
| `LTX Reference to Video` | MSR/reference-image mapping for the LTX Reference-to-Video workflow |
| `Ingredients to Video` | Complete Ingredients sheets and per-scene sheet mapping |
| `ID-LoRA Ref Builder` | Character identity images, voices, locations, dialogue, and automatic or manual scene durations |
| `MiniMax H3 References` | Ordered character, location, extra-image, video-edit, and voice data appropriate to the active H3 mode |

Basic Reference Builder workflow:

1. Choose `Flux Klein` or `Nano B` in the `Image` tab, or choose `Reference to Video` / `Ingredients to Video` in the `Video` tab.
2. Click `Reference Builder` in the top bar.
3. Turn on `Use subject reference` and/or `Use mapped location references`.
4. Add character and location references.
5. Map locations to scenes.
6. Click `Save Reference Builder`.
7. Generate images normally from the `Image` tab.

For `Reference to Video`, focus on subject/MSR references and singer/subject mapping. For `Ingredients to Video`, open the Ingredients Reference Builder, upload sheet images, describe them if needed, and map sheets to scenes before running video prompts.

For a MiniMax H3 project, Reference Builder hides LTX-only choices and follows the active H3 mode. Reference-to-Video uses ordered mapped images; Video-to-Video adds ordered edit images and the Video tab's source-video rows. The active scene's MiniMax chooser can override the automatic mapped-image order without changing other scenes. In Short Film + Built-in Audio, character cards also show `MiniMax built-in voice`; the saved preset name and description are copied exactly into prompts where that character speaks.

### Character References

Character references are for identity. They help supported image models keep a face, hair, outfit, or character design consistent.

Important controls:

| Control | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `Character count` | Number of character reference slots |
| Character name/label | The natural name used in mapping, such as `the woman`, `the man`, or a character name |
| `Subject description` | Text description used for creating or understanding the subject |
| Drop/upload box | Add a subject reference image |
| `Create Subject with ZImage` | Generates a subject/reference sheet from the description |
| `Upload Subject Image` | Uploads a custom subject reference |
| `Clear Subject` | Removes the subject image |

If there is only one character, give it a useful label. Avoid leaving it as `Character 1` if you want prompts to sound natural.

### Location References

Location references are for environment identity. They help supported image models understand the location without forcing the exact same camera angle.

Important controls:

| Control | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `Add Location` | Adds a location slot |
| `Location name` | Short label shown in mapping dropdowns |
| `Description / prompt` | Text description for the location |
| Drop/upload box | Add a location reference image |
| `Create with ZImage` | Generates a location reference image |
| `Upload` | Uploads a custom location image |
| `Clear` | Removes the image but keeps the location slot |
| `Remove` | Deletes the location slot |

### Extract And Map Locations

`Extract Locations` asks Gemma to find location ideas from existing scene prompts, director notes, video notes, lyric context, or project context.

`Auto Map Locations with Gemma` asks Gemma to assign the existing location list to scenes. You can always change the dropdowns manually afterward.

Use `Auto Map Locations with Gemma` after location slots exist. If no locations exist yet, use `Extract Locations` or add locations manually first.

For longer projects, bulk assignment can rotate the saved locations or use `Repeat each location for X scenes`. Repeating blocks are useful when several consecutive shots should remain inside one environment before the video moves to the next location.

### Map Subjects From Lyrics

`Map Subjects From Lyrics` uses saved lyric/singer mapping to assign characters to scenes. This works best after you have used `Review Lines + Map Performers` and saved the line mapping.

It does not overwrite your lyric text. It only helps connect scene references to the subjects used in those lyric/singer choices.

`Map Subjects From Scene Notes` is the non-lyric alternative. It reads `SceneNotes.json` and assigns saved characters when notes mention their names.

For external GPT-assisted mapping, `Export GPT Context` copies/saves subjects, locations, line text, and current mappings and opens the Scene Mapping Assistant. Paste the returned mapping through `Import GPT Map` to assign existing saved references back to scenes. `GPT Scout` does the same kind of handoff for discovering reusable locations. Location lists can also be imported/exported directly. Always review imported names before applying because mappings can only target references that exist in the project.

`Assign Scenes` provides a preview-first bulk mapper. It can fill characters and locations randomly, rotate them, or repeat each location for a chosen number of scenes. Fill-empty mode preserves existing assignments; `Replace existing mappings` overwrites them. Scenes marked `No character present` remain character-free even when a location is assigned.

### Ingredients Sheet Mapping

Ingredients sheet mapping connects a complete reference sheet image to one or more scenes.

Use it when the selected video mode is `Ingredients to Video`.

The usual flow is:

1. Open `Reference Builder` while `Ingredients to Video` is active.
2. Add one or more Ingredients sheet images.
3. Use vision Gemma to describe sheets when the description is blank or unclear.
4. Map each scene to the matching sheet.
5. Save Reference Builder.
6. Run `Gemma Ingredients Video` or `LLM Video All`.

If lyric/singer mapping already knows which subject appears in each scene, the Builder can sync Ingredients scene mapping from those subject mappings.

![Reference Builder with character and location mappings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vrgamegirl19/comfyui-vrgamedevgirl/refs/heads/main/Workflows/LTX-2_Workflows/Video_Builder/images/Reference%20Builder%20with%20character%20and%20location%20mappings.png)

## Video Wizard

The `Wizard` button opens a guided setup flow. It does not replace the main Builder; it calls the same tools in a more ordered path.

Use the Wizard when you want the builder to walk through:

| Step | What it helps with |
| --- | --- |
| Mode setup | Choose `Image to Video` or `Reference to Video` and choose the image backend |
| Model settings | Apply video, image, LoRA, Gemma, MSR, and Ingredients defaults back to the builder |
| Audio | Load global timeline audio |
| Lyrics and scenes | Paste reference lyrics and create timeline scenes |
| References | Open the correct Reference Builder mode for the selected video mode |
| Lyric review | Open lyric timing, singer, B-roll, instrumental, location, and Ingredients mapping tools |
| Scene defaults | Set image shot flow, aesthetic, image-world direction, consistency phrase, video camera flow, camera/character motion speeds, performance style, and facial performance |
| Story layer | Set the same enabled state, lyric strength, overall story idea, user story arc, and song story brief used by Storyboard Builder; create lyric sections and per-scene story beats |
| Prompts/build | Run LLM image prompts, Storyboard/LLM video prompts, and Build Full Video |

The Wizard saves draft progress into the project when possible, so you can close it and continue later.

For `Reference to Video`, the Wizard can run the same Storyboard prompt writer used by Storyboard Builder. `Ingredients to Video` remains available from the main UI and Ingredients Reference Builder.

Recommended Wizard workflow:

1. Create or load and save a project before opening `Wizard`.
2. Choose the video mode and image backend first; this determines which model/reference steps appear.
3. Review the model defaults. Apply them to the Builder only after the required files appear in the selectors.
4. Load global audio and paste/import the lyrics.
5. Create scenes, then open lyric review to correct timing, singers, instrumental/B-roll flags, and locations.
6. Add and map references for modes that require them.
7. Set the image-world, consistency, camera speed, character speed, performance, and facial defaults under Scene Defaults. For MiniMax, also set `Cut frequency`: 0 is one continuous take, while higher values produce an exact duration-aware `CUT TO` plan. Apply image shot/aesthetic and video camera flow as needed. `Fill Missing` preserves scene-level work; `Replace All` intentionally rewrites that category across every scene.
8. Under Story Direction, set the overall idea and lyric strength, then build the user story arc, story brief, and missing scene beats if the project needs a continuous narrative. These are the same shared fields shown in Storyboard Builder.
9. Run image prompts and review images before running video prompts.
10. Use the Wizard's full-build action only after a few representative scenes work correctly.

If you close the Wizard, reopen it and continue from the saved project. The Wizard is an ordered launcher; every result is still visible and editable in the main Builder.

## Storyboard Builder

`Storyboard Builder` is a planning workspace for scene cards before or during image/video generation.

![Storyboard Builder main window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vrgamegirl19/comfyui-vrgamedevgirl/refs/heads/main/Workflows/LTX-2_Workflows/Video_Builder/images/storyboardbuilder/story%20board%20builder%20main%20UI%20window.png)

Use it when you want stronger control over:

| Tool | What it helps with |
| --- | --- |
| Scene cards | Review scene status, prompts, selected images, video prompts, and notes |
| Story brief | Create a compact project summary from lyrics, sections, subjects, and locations |
| Story arc | Build a song-structure story plan across verses, chorus, bridge, intro, or outro |
| Scene beats | Add per-scene story intent from the larger arc |
| Camera motion | Choose from camera-flow presets or specific camera motion categories |
| Still style | Choose image prompt style presets such as cinematic, editorial, beauty, analog, surreal, or studio |
| Performance style | Apply music-video performance presets such as pop, rock, metal, rap, ballad, EDM, or B-roll |
| Facial performance | Keep singing/acting prompts consistent with the lyric or instrumental state |
| Storyboard Gemma All | Write video prompts across scenes using Storyboard context |

Storyboard Builder works especially well with saved lyric mapping and Reference Builder data. For Reference-to-Video projects, it can enforce clearer facial/lip-sync behavior and add reference-aware trigger phrasing before writing video prompts back into the Video Builder scenes.

For MiniMax H3 projects, Storyboard Builder shows the four H3 modes, writes the separate H3 prompt field, includes exact scene timing and ordered image/video/audio references, and preserves H3-specific settings when cards are saved back to Video Builder. It does not run the normal LTX prompt rewrites on H3 scenes.

The collapsible `Story Layer` keeps the overall idea, lyric strength, user story arc, song story brief, lyric sections, and scene-beat creation controls together.

![Storyboard Builder Story Layer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vrgamegirl19/comfyui-vrgamedevgirl/refs/heads/main/Workflows/LTX-2_Workflows/Video_Builder/images/storyboardbuilder/storylayer.png)

The current Storyboard Builder includes several planning and safety improvements:

- repeated verse/chorus/bridge sections remain distinct when the story arc is created or updated
- Story Arc requires the detected lyric headings in their original order; if Gemma returns every required heading and only appends invented trailing sections, those extras are removed automatically, while missing, renamed, reordered, or interleaved headings still stop the result
- saved character descriptions follow the mapped characters into FLF endpoint planning
- the visual subject picker assigns one or more existing Reference Builder subjects to a scene or uploads a new subject without leaving the Storyboard
- Storyboard imports merge incoming subjects and locations with saved project references instead of discarding new mappings
- bulk scene assignment can rotate locations or `Repeat each location for X scenes`
- Video Prep shows Motion Notes inline; custom Motion Notes override the scene-default camera-motion preset when Gemma builds the prompt, preventing conflicting camera instructions
- starting-shot choices are enforced at the beginning of non-I2V prompts, including an explicit extreme close-up for an eyes shot
- the all-scenes Gemma action can fill only missing prompts or redo every visible scene and shows the exact missing/completed counts before it starts
- missing-only prompt batches preserve completed prompts and save successful partial progress if a later scene fails
- `Clear All Story Beats` clears only the per-scene story-beat field, preserving lyrics, prompts, references, images, locations, and shot settings
- scene cards and controls reflow more cleanly on smaller or resized Storyboard windows
- ID-LoRA projects can generate, review, and apply a speaking short-film dialogue plan from saved characters, locations, and an optional premise/script
- MiniMax Short Film + Built-in Audio projects can use Guided Film Automation or Fully Custom authoring, assign ordered speaker cues, and create timeline segments only after the storyboard is reviewed
- MiniMax Script Mapper can import `.txt`/`.json` dialogue, require every speaker to match a saved Reference Builder character, preserve exact cue order/text, and split the plan into H3-safe scene durations

Recommended Storyboard Builder workflow:

1. Save the Video Builder project with scenes, lyric mapping, and any Reference Builder subjects/locations.
2. Open `Storyboard Builder`.
3. Choose `Image Prep` when planning still-image prompts or `Video Prep` when planning motion/video prompts from existing scene images.
4. Click `Detect Lyric Sections`, review the verse/chorus/bridge labels, and correct scene cards when needed.
5. Enter the story direction and click `Create Story Brief`.
6. Click `Create User Story Arc`; review every song section before using it to make scene beats.
7. Click `Create Missing Scene Beats` to preserve existing beats, or `Replace All Scene Beats` only when intentionally rebuilding them.
8. Choose the shot/still aesthetic in Image Prep, or camera flow, motion speed, performance style, character speed, and facial performance in Video Prep.
9. Use `Fill Missing` to protect manual scene choices. Use `Replace All` only when the selected preset should overwrite every scene.
10. Open individual scene cards to correct the lyric section, story beat, subjects, location, starting shot, camera direction, Motion Notes, performance, or facial direction.
11. Click the all-scenes Gemma button, choose `Create missing only` to protect finished prompts or `Redo every visible scene` for a deliberate rewrite, then inspect several scene cards for identity, location, singing, starting-shot, and motion accuracy.
12. Click `Save Storyboard`. Use `Export Prompt Files` when another tool needs the generated files.

Image Prep scene defaults control still-shot flow, image aesthetic, world style, consistency, performance, and facial direction:

![Storyboard Builder Image Prep scene defaults](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vrgamegirl19/comfyui-vrgamedevgirl/refs/heads/main/Workflows/LTX-2_Workflows/Video_Builder/images/storyboardbuilder/scenedefaultsimagepred.png)

Video Prep scene defaults control camera flow and speed, character motion, performance style, facial performance, and the consistency phrase used across video prompts:

![Storyboard Builder Video Prep scene defaults](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vrgamegirl19/comfyui-vrgamedevgirl/refs/heads/main/Workflows/LTX-2_Workflows/Video_Builder/images/storyboardbuilder/scene%20defaults%20video%20prep.png)

`Clear Prompts` removes generated prompt fields but keeps planning choices. `Clear All Story Beats` removes only story beats. When a generated story arc invents a different setting, correct the mapped `location_ref`; the mapped location is the required physical set.

Storyboard Gemma image/video prompt requests allow up to ten minutes per scene. A timeout now says that the backend may still be processing the request; wait for the ComfyUI queue/console before retrying so two expensive generations do not overlap. If the message says `Connection to the ComfyUI backend was lost`, confirm ComfyUI is still running. A local GGUF load that closes the backend often needs fewer GPU layers, a smaller context limit, or a smaller model.

## Start Image Storyboard Creator

Add the node `VRGDG Storyboard Creator with Browser AI — Open This` to open the standalone start-image storyboard workspace. It reads an existing Video Builder project instead of creating a separate timeline.

The creator can:

| Feature | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `Load Video Builder Project` | Imports scene order, lyric lines, notes, and saved Reference Builder mappings |
| `Refresh Project Mappings` | Reloads lyrics and character/location mappings after the main project changes |
| Global story idea / visual style | Adds project-wide creative direction to every generated scene prompt |
| Provider and layout selectors | Switches between Flow, GPT Image, and Meta AI, and between `Grid / Tiles` and `List` scene-card layouts |
| `LLM Settings` | Chooses Gemma Local, LM Studio, or a configured LLM API for prompt creation and editing |
| Global or per-scene character reference | Keeps identity guidance consistent while allowing a scene-specific override |
| Mapped location reference | Sends the saved location image and description with the scene prompt |
| Location sub-area | Names a specific area inside a mapped location or lets Browser AI select a different believable area automatically |
| `Start + End Frames` | Enables paired storyboard endpoints for FLF projects |
| Click/drop frame slots | Loads a custom start or end image directly into an individual scene card |
| Shot and end-transition controls | Selects the opening composition and describes the later pose, action, destination, or camera transition |
| `LLM Create Prompt` / `LLM Edit Prompt` | Creates or revises a scene prompt with Gemma Local, LM Studio, or a configured LLM API |
| `Send Prompt` / `Send Image + Prompt` | Opens the selected provider with text only or with the available start/end frame references |
| `Send Character + Location + Prompt` | Sends the character sheet, mapped physical location, attachment roles, and scene prompt together |
| `Create 5 Start Options` | Requests five separate composition choices using the character and mapped location references |
| `Create End from Start` | Sends the chosen start plus ending direction to create the later endpoint |
| `Batch Agent Brief` | Sends several consecutive scenes as a continuity-focused brief with shot progression and optional previous-scene context |
| `Import Current Start Frames` | Copies currently selected Video Builder scene images into the creator, either only where missing or by replacing all creator starts while retaining prior attempts |
| `Import Latest as Start/End` | Imports the newest provider download into the correct storyboard frame slot |

`Batch Agent Brief` can target a scene range, use a fallback location where no project location is mapped, add custom direction, and choose a cinematic, character, intensity, reveal, or per-scene shot progression. Its continuity controls can preserve identity, wardrobe, and visual style, vary compositions, and include the previous scene image. It sends the global character sheet plus each mapped location reference with explicit attachment roles.

The Browser AI integration supports Flow, GPT Image, and Meta AI. The location prompt treats a saved location as a three-dimensional environment and asks for new camera positions, believable floor contact, depth, shadows, reflections, color spill, and occlusion instead of pasting the character over the reference or repeating the same composition. Reused locations are told to move to a substantially different sub-area and camera composition.

The creator saves previous attempts when frames are replaced. `Import Current Start Frames` offers `Import Missing Only` or `Replace All Start Frames`, and replacement preserves the old creator frames in the storyboard attempts folders.

When `Start + End Frames` is enabled, exported files use paired names such as `scene_0001.png` and `scene_0001_end.png`. `Fill Timeline Images From Folder` recognizes that convention and imports the folder into Video Builder as independent FLF pairs.

Recommended Start Image Storyboard workflow:

1. Save the main Video Builder project after completing scene timing, lyric mapping, and Reference Builder mappings.
2. Add `VRGDG Storyboard Creator with Browser AI — Open This` and click `Open Storyboard Creator`.
3. Paste/browse to the saved project folder and click `Load Video Builder Project`.
4. Choose the Browser AI provider and use `LLM Settings` to select Gemma Local, LM Studio, or an API runner.
5. Add a global story/style idea and a global character sheet; keep `Use global reference for every scene` enabled unless scenes need separate identities.
6. Use `Refresh Project Mappings` whenever the main Builder's lyrics or references change.
7. For each scene, confirm the mapped location, optionally name a different location sub-area, choose a shot preset, and create/edit the prompt.
8. Use `Send Character + Location + Prompt` or `Create 5 Start Options`, download the chosen result, and click `Import Latest as Start`.
9. For FLF projects, enable `Start + End Frames`, choose an end transition/add an ending note, click `Create End from Start`, and import the result as the end frame.
10. Use `Batch Agent Brief` for consecutive scenes that need shared identity, wardrobe, style, and shot progression.
11. Click `Save`.
12. Back in Video Builder, use `Fill Timeline Images From Folder` to import the numbered start/end files as independent FLF pairs.

Use `Import Current Start Frames` in the opposite direction when the main Builder already has approved starts that the standalone creator should continue from.

## Face Fix

Open the left `Tools` tab and choose `Face Fix (Experimental)` after a scene has a selected rendered video. The integrated Face Fix repairs blurry distant faces while preserving the original full frame outside the feathered repair area.

Basic workflow:

1. Select a scene video and scrub to the beginning of the bad-face range.
2. Click `Set IN`, scrub within the same scene, and click `Set OUT`; or choose the whole-scene option.
3. Move to a clear frame, click `Use Playhead as Description Frame`, and generate or edit the face description.
4. Choose the repair-distance preset, detection settings, anchor interval, feathering, and color match.
5. Use a preview action if needed, then click `Start Face Fix`.

The tool detects and tracks one primary face, prepares safe 512×512 anchors, enhances those anchors with the current Z-Enhance setup, uses LTX 2.3 for temporal consistency, then feathers and color-matches the repaired face frames back into the original scene video. The repaired video is added to that scene's video history and selected automatically.

Smaller anchor intervals are slower but improve consistency. The first and final frames are always included. `Repair distance` prevents already-large/close faces from being unnecessarily replaced, and the custom threshold lets you choose the face-width percentage where the repair fades out.

## Builder Agent

The `Agent` button opens the `Builder Agent`, a chat helper for planning, editing, troubleshooting, and optionally applying changes to the project.

The Agent is useful when you want help with:

| Task | Example request |
| --- | --- |
| Learning the workflow | `Walk me through what to do next.` |
| Scene planning | `Rewrite Scene 5 notes to match the previous scene.` |
| Prompt cleanup | `Make this image prompt more cinematic but keep the subject the same.` |
| Video motion | `Create stronger camera motion for Scene 8.` |
| Story planning | `Plan this whole song as a multi-character video.` |
| Troubleshooting | `Why is this scene not ready to render?` |

Agent controls:

| Control | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| `Context sent to Gemma` | How much project context the Agent receives |
| `Active scene only` | Best for focused changes to the selected scene |
| `Active scene + neighbors` | Best for continuity around the selected scene |
| `Project brief` | Best for overall advice without sending every scene |
| `Full scene plan` | Best for Story Builder and large planning tasks |
| `Agent mode: Manual` | Suggest only; does not apply changes |
| `Agent mode: Auto` | Can update fields, switch modes, select scenes, and run supported actions |
| `Purpose: Beginner help` | Helps a new user step through setup |
| `Purpose: Scene work` | Helps with scene notes, prompts, images, and video |
| `Purpose: Story Builder` | Helps plan a multi-scene story or character structure |
| `Purpose: Troubleshoot` | Helps diagnose missing setup or failed steps |
| `Hint` | Shows examples of what the Agent can do |
| `Pop Out` | Moves the Agent to its own browser window |
| `Min` | Minimizes the Agent without closing the chat |
| `Clear Chat` | Clears the current Agent conversation |

Reference and story tools:

| Tool | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| `Drop reference image` | Give the Agent a visual reference for the active scene |
| `Upload Ref` | Upload one or more reference images |
| `Add Audio` | Add global/timeline audio while using Story Builder |
| `Story Source` | Paste or edit lyrics/script/source text for Story Builder |
| `Upload Story Images` | Add singers, characters, locations, or aesthetic images |
| `Analyze Images` | Turn story images into compact notes for text-only planning |

Recommended beginner use:

1. Open `Agent`.
2. Set `Agent mode` to `Manual: suggest only`.
3. Set `Purpose` to `Beginner help`.
4. Ask what to do next.
5. Switch to `Scene work` when you want help with a selected scene.
6. Use `Auto: update fields` only when you are comfortable letting it make edits.

![Builder Agent Window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vrgamegirl19/comfyui-vrgamedevgirl/refs/heads/main/Workflows/LTX-2_Workflows/Video_Builder/images/Builder%20Agent%20Window.png)

![Builder Agent Hints](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vrgamegirl19/comfyui-vrgamedevgirl/refs/heads/main/Workflows/LTX-2_Workflows/Video_Builder/images/Builder%20Agent%20Hints.png)

## Prompt Options

The `Prompt Options` button opens tools for editing, creating, reloading, or clearing final prompt text files for the project.

Use this when the scene prompt boxes need to be refreshed from saved prompt files, or when you want to edit generated prompts in a larger text editor-style workflow.

Prompt Options has two groups:

| Group | Buttons |
| --- | --- |
| `Image` | `Create Concept Prompts`, `Edit Text to Image Prompts`, `Reload Text to Image Prompts`, `Reload Original T2I Prompts`, `Clear All T2I Prompts` |
| `Video` | `Create Motion Notes`, `Edit Image to Video Prompts`, `Reload Image to Video Prompts`, `Reload Original I2V Prompts`, `Clear All I2V Prompts` |

The same window also provides `Transcribe Lines For Timeline` and `Find / Replace Prompts`. Find/replace matches the full phrase across saved image prompts, video prompts, or both. Use `Preview Matches` first, choose whether matching is case-sensitive, then use `Replace All`. Replacements are treated as manual prompt edits, so later render preparation does not silently add automatic trigger or performance wording to them.

If the current image mode is `Flux/Klein` or `Nano B`, the image prompt buttons change names to match that mode.

Use caution with the clear buttons. They remove prompt text from the project stage they describe.

Prompts typed or pasted manually—including Prompt Options edits, reloads, and find/replace results—remain manual when rendered. Automatic trigger phrases, vocal/facial-performance directions, and ID-LoRA augmentation are applied only to prompts originally created by Gemma. This prevents a later Gemma edit or final render preparation from silently rewriting a manual prompt or appending facial direction twice.

### Editing Prompt Files

The editor accepts several formats:

Important: after you edit and save T2I or I2V prompt text in the Prompt Options editor, use the matching reload button before running builds. Saving updates the prompt file on disk. Reloading copies the saved prompt file back into the scene prompt boxes the builder uses.

Blank-line format:

```text
Prompt for scene 1

Prompt for scene 2

Prompt for scene 3
```

Key/value format:

```text
Prompt1=Prompt for scene 1
Prompt2=Prompt for scene 2
Prompt3=Prompt for scene 3
```

For I2V prompts:

```text
I2V1=Video prompt for scene 1
I2V2=Video prompt for scene 2
```

JSON format:

```json
{
  "Prompt1": "Prompt for scene 1",
  "Prompt2": "Prompt for scene 2"
}
```

For I2V prompts:

```json
{
  "I2V1": "Video prompt for scene 1",
  "I2V2": "Video prompt for scene 2"
}
```

### Reloading And Clearing Prompts

| Button | What it changes |
| --- | --- |
| `Reload Text to Image Prompts` | Loads the current T2I prompt file into scene prompt boxes after editing/saving |
| `Reload Original T2I Prompts` | Restores the first backup made by the prompt editor |
| `Clear All T2I Prompts` | Clears saved image prompts only |
| `Reload Image to Video Prompts` | Loads the current I2V prompt file into scene prompt boxes after editing/saving |
| `Reload Original I2V Prompts` | Restores the first backup made by the prompt editor |
| `Clear All I2V Prompts` | Clears saved video prompts only |

Clearing prompts does not delete images, videos, LoRAs, reference images, model choices, seeds, scene notes, video notes, or lyric notes.

Gemma instruction editors are separate from final prompt-file editing. The relevant image/video mode exposes its own `Edit ... Instructions` control. An instruction override can be saved for only the selected scene or for all scenes in the project, reset at either scope, or saved as a shared preset. Loading a preset places its text in the editor for review; it is not active until you click `Save for This Scene` or `Save for All Scenes`. The editor warns before closing with unsaved changes.

## LLM Runner

The `LLM Runner` button controls which runner writes Builder, Storyboard, Wizard, Prompt Creator, and supported image-reference prompts. Text-only work can use any runner. Supported vision work can use Gemma Local, LM Studio with a vision-capable model, or a vision-capable LLM API model. A few explicitly local-only drafts still use the built-in runner; progress windows name the runner actually used.

Options:

| Runner | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| `builtin` | Uses the built-in local GGUF text/vision runner and the selected GGUF/mmproj files |
| `lm_studio` | Uses LM Studio's local server for text and supported vision calls; load a model with the required capability |
| `llm_api` | Uses the configured API provider/model for text and supported vision calls; choose a vision-capable model when images are attached |

Gemma Local setup fields:

| Field | What it controls |
| --- | --- |
| `Context limit / n_ctx` | Total local GGUF input/output context window |
| `Maximum output tokens` | Maximum generated text for one request; current Builder tasks use this ceiling instead of their older small hardcoded limits |
| `GPU layers / n_gpu_layers` | Number of local GGUF layers placed on the GPU; lower this when model loading exhausts VRAM |

The context and requested output must fit within the model's supported window. Large values can substantially increase RAM/VRAM use and response time.

LM Studio setup fields:

| Field | What to enter |
| --- | --- |
| `LM Studio base URL` | Usually `http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1` |
| `Available LM Studio models` | Click `Load LM Studio Models` to fill this |
| `LM Studio model name` | The loaded chat model name from LM Studio |
| `API key` | Usually blank for local LM Studio |
| `Input context limit` | Context length sent to LM Studio for each text or vision request |
| `Maximum output tokens` | Maximum response length sent to LM Studio |
| `Test LM Studio` | Sends a tiny test prompt to confirm it works |

LLM API setup fields:

| Field | What to enter |
| --- | --- |
| `Provider` | Configured API provider |
| `Model` | Provider model used for prompt writing; select a vision-capable model for image-reference jobs |
| `API key` | Provider key. It is session-only and is not written into the saved project |
| `Test LLM API` | Sends a tiny test prompt and reports the provider/model response |

The Gemma Local and LM Studio context/output limits do not cap commercial/API LLM requests; the selected API model/provider controls those limits.

When a batch run is active, progress windows show the runner name so you can tell whether a text-only pass is using `LM Studio`, `API LLM`, or the built-in runner.

If LM Studio does not list models:

1. Open LM Studio.
2. Go to the Local Server tab.
3. Load a chat model.
4. Start the server.
5. Return to the builder and click `Load LM Studio Models`.

To choose a runner:

1. Click `LLM Runner`.
2. Choose `builtin`, `lm_studio`, or `llm_api`.
3. Fill the fields for that runner. For local runners, keep context/output values within the loaded model's capacity; use the runner's test action when available.
4. Save the runner settings.
5. Run one representative text or image-reference scene prompt and confirm the progress window names the expected runner before starting a batch.

![Gemma Runner Window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vrgamegirl19/comfyui-vrgamedevgirl/refs/heads/main/Workflows/LTX-2_Workflows/Video_Builder/images/Gemma%20Runner%20Window.png)

![Gemma Runner with LM Studio model dropdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vrgamegirl19/comfyui-vrgamedevgirl/refs/heads/main/Workflows/LTX-2_Workflows/Video_Builder/images/Gemma%20Runner%20with%20LM%20Studio%20model%20dropdown.png)

## Batch Buttons and Full Builds

The `Menu` contains batch tools that can work across many scenes.

| Button | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `LLM T2I All` | Creates image prompts for multiple scenes |
| `LLM Video All` | Creates the active LTX-mode prompts or separate MiniMax H3 prompts for multiple scenes |
| `Image All` | Creates missing image prompts if needed, then creates missing images |
| `Enhance All` | Enhances every scene that already has an image using its saved prompt and active Enhance settings |
| `Render All` | Renders missing scene videos and can stitch when possible |
| `Stitch Preview` | Stitches selected or ranged existing scene videos into a preview |
| `Image Slideshow Preview` | Builds a preview from the current scene images, their timeline durations, and the matching global-audio range without rendering scene videos |
| `Build Full Video` | Runs the larger pipeline from prompts/images/videos through final stitch |
| `Build Full FLF Video` | Runs the First/Last Frame endpoint, image-chain, prompt, render, final-frame extraction, and stitch stages |
| `Stop` | Stops the current workflow run |

In `Reference to Video` mode, `LLM Video All` can use the Storyboard prompt writer when launched through the Wizard. In `Ingredients to Video` mode, make sure Ingredients sheets are mapped before running the batch prompt step. `Gemma Video All` asks whether to create only missing prompts or redo every visible scene and shows the completed/missing counts before the batch begins.

When prompted, choose the safest option first:

| Option | Best for |
| --- | --- |
| Resume missing only | Continue without replacing finished work |
| Keep prompts, redo images/videos | Make new media but preserve prompt work |
| Redo prompts and images/videos | Start fresh for the selected stage |

Build Full Video options:

| Option | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `Resume missing only` | Keeps existing prompts, selected images, and selected videos. Only creates missing pieces, then stitches |
| `Fresh full rebuild` | Regenerates prompts, images, video prompts, and videos |
| `Keep images, redo I2V prompts and videos` | Keeps selected images, regenerates video prompts and scene videos |
| `Keep images and prompts, redo videos` | Keeps selected images and existing video prompts, creates new scene videos |

Some rebuild choices let you keep the current seeds or randomize them. Keep seeds when you want a similar result with changed settings, such as adding a LoRA. Randomize seeds when you want a fresh variation.

`Image All` is image-only. It stops after the images are created so you can review them before generating videos.

In `First Last Frame` mode, `Image All` also offers the dedicated chained and independent endpoint workflows described earlier. Those choices prepare images and FLF prompts but still do not render scene videos.

`Render All` is video/stitch focused. It does not regenerate image prompts or images unless the selected build option says so.

During `Render All`, the persistent render log shows the current scene, phase, elapsed time, per-scene timing, estimated time remaining, and final-stitch timing. When the run finishes or stops, the Builder saves JSON and text reports with the project so you can review completed scenes, failures, and timing after the progress window closes.

In a MiniMax H3 project, `LLM Video All` creates the separate H3 prompts for the effective mode of each scene. `Render All` uses the dedicated H3 workflow, honors global settings or a scene's locked override, applies exact timeline trim, and stitches the selected H3 clips. It does not route those scenes through LTX post-processing or LTX canvas/audio options.

![Build Full Video Options](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vrgamegirl19/comfyui-vrgamedevgirl/refs/heads/main/Workflows/LTX-2_Workflows/Video_Builder/images/Build%20Full%20Video%20Options.png)

When the finished video is stitched, the builder shows a `Final Video Ready` popup. Use `Open Video` to preview it.

Safe batch workflow:

1. Save the project and test one representative scene from prompt through video.
2. Use `LLM T2I All` and inspect several prompts.
3. Use `Image All`, then review/select scene images.
4. Use `LLM Video All` and inspect singing, no-lip-sync, identity, and motion instructions.
5. Use `Render All` to create only missing videos.
6. Use `Stitch Preview` for a quick check, then `Build Full Video`/final stitch when the sequence is ready.
7. Choose `Resume missing only` after interruptions. Use redo options only when you intend to replace completed outputs.
8. If something is wrong, click `Stop`; completed scene outputs remain available, and a later resume can continue the missing work.

![Final Video Ready Popup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vrgamegirl19/comfyui-vrgamedevgirl/refs/heads/main/Workflows/LTX-2_Workflows/Video_Builder/images/Final%20Video%20Ready%20Popup.png)

## Post Process

The left panel has three tabs: `Scenes`, `Tools`, and `Post Process`.

Use `Post Process` after images or videos exist and you want to style, compare, or finish them.

The automatic MiniMax H3 render/stitch path currently skips LTX Post Process workflow settings. The controls in this section describe the established LTX/scene-finishing path; do not assume an H3 `Render All` will apply them.

Post Process tools:

| Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `LUTS` | Shows installed `.cube` LUTs and applies a look to the selected scene |
| `Adjust` | Changes color, lightness, and finish controls for the selected scene and supports reusable presets |
| `Film Grain` | Applies film-grain settings to the selected scene media |
| `FX` | Opens overlay and visual-FX tools |
| Compare preview | Shows before/after post-process previews in the center preview area |

LUT tips:

- Click a LUT to apply it to the selected scene.
- Drag a LUT onto a scene when you want to target a specific scene.
- Use `Refresh` if you add new `.cube` files while ComfyUI is open.
- The included LUT examples live under the repo's `LUTS/examples` folder.

`Adjust` includes temperature, tint, saturation, exposure, contrast, highlights, shadows, whites, blacks, sharpen, clarity, vignette, and fade. Enable scene adjust and change at least one value before previewing. `Live preview` updates a still frame after slider changes; `Preview Adjust` also renders only a preview frame, while `Render Adjust for Scene` processes the selected scene media. `Apply to all scenes` copies the settings project-wide. Global presets live under `output/VRGDG_AdjustPresets` and can be applied, saved, imported, or refreshed without restarting the Builder.

Post-process changes are scene-level choices. Save the project after choosing looks so the builder can keep those selections with the session.

To post-process a scene:

1. Select a scene with an image or rendered video.
2. Open the left `Post Process` tab.
3. For a LUT, choose an installed `.cube` file and preview it before applying; use `Refresh` after adding LUT files.
4. For grain or FX, start with a low strength and preview the result.
5. Use the compare view to check the processed result against the unprocessed source.
6. Apply the chosen result, verify the correct history item is selected, and save the project.
7. Test one scene before repeating the same treatment across the project.

## Prompt Creator (Legacy)

Prompt Creator is the older, file-based planning workflow for turning a song, lyrics, SRT timing, and user ideas into concept prompts and motion notes. It remains available for older projects and users who specifically need its saved prompt-package workflow.

For new projects, use Storyboard Builder. It is the newer workflow for keeping story direction, scene beats, references, image defaults, motion defaults, and generated prompts together in the same project.

`New Project` now opens Video Builder directly. To use the older workflow, open `Prompt Creator (Legacy)` from the Builder tools. Read the warning and choose either `Continue to Prompt Creator` or `Continue to Video Builder`.

Prompt Creator can create:

| Output | Used by |
| --- | --- |
| SRT/scene timing | Video Builder scene timing |
| Lyric segments | Concept prompt creation and no-vocal detection |
| Extracted subject | Subject prefix and reference context |
| Theme/style | Global visual direction |
| Story idea | Overall story direction |
| Subject and locations | Characters, locations, and scene context |
| Concept prompts | Image/T2I notes in Video Builder |
| I2V motion notes | Video motion notes in Video Builder |

Main Prompt Creator controls:

| Control | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `Audio file` | Song/audio file used for Whisper/SRT timing |
| `Language` | Whisper language hint |
| `Use SRT duration file` | Uses detected beat/SRT timing instead of fixed duration |
| `Fixed scene duration` | Used when SRT duration is off |
| `Empty lyric segment text` | Text used for no-vocal/blank segments, such as `Instrumental section.` |
| `Append subject to Concept Prompts` | Adds the extracted subject to the start of each concept prompt |
| `Min duration` / `Max duration` | Controls scene duration bounds |
| `Bias` | Guides how strongly the duration logic prefers longer/shorter timing choices |
| `Duration preset` | Chooses the scene timing style |
| `Concept lyric match` | Controls how tightly concept prompts follow the lyrics |
| `Gemma4 text model` | Non-vision model used for Prompt Creator text steps |

User input boxes:

| Box | What to put there |
| --- | --- |
| `Full lyrics` | Full song lyrics. Use the `Sonauto` button if you need a free music creator link |
| `Style/theme` | Visual style, color, mood, genre, or art direction |
| `Story idea` | Overall music video story or structure |
| `Subject and locations` | Characters, outfits, locations, props, and setting details |

Prompt Creator buttons:

| Button | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `Gemma4 Lyrics` | Helps clean or draft lyric text |
| `Gemma4` buttons on context boxes | Drafts that specific context field |
| `Use GPT` | Uses the alternate GPT helper path when available |
| `Edit Instructions` | Opens custom instructions for that Prompt Creator step |
| `Run` | Runs the full Prompt Creator pipeline |
| `Run: Skip Whisper/SRT` | Uses existing SRT/segment data and runs the later prompt steps |
| `Save Project Draft` | Saves the Prompt Creator draft |
| `Load Project Draft` | Opens a saved Prompt Creator draft |
| `Send To AI Video Builder` | Sends saved Prompt Creator output into Video Builder |
| `Back To AI Video Builder` | Returns to Video Builder without necessarily importing new data |

### Concept Lyric Match

`Concept lyric match` controls how literal concept prompts should be.

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Super tight/literal | Use visible lyric objects and actions whenever possible |
| Medium | Keep at least one recognizable lyric object or action while still following story/style |
| Loose | Use the lyric as inspiration, but allow the story and visuals more freedom |
| Super light | Treat lyrics mostly as mood and pacing |

Use tighter settings for lyric-symbolic videos. Use looser settings for abstract, cinematic, or story-first videos.

### Custom Prompt Creator Instructions

Each Prompt Creator Gemma step can have custom instructions.

Use this only when you know what you want to change. Bad instructions can make Gemma produce invalid, short, repeated, or unusable outputs.

Use presets or restore defaults if a custom instruction causes problems.

### Prompt Creator To Video Builder

After running or editing Prompt Creator:

1. Click `Save Project Draft`.
2. Click `Send To AI Video Builder`.
3. In Video Builder, confirm scenes, notes, prompt paths, audio, and SRT timing came over.
4. Use `Import Data From Prompt Creator` or Prompt Options reload buttons if needed.

## Prompt Creator Import

The builder can import data from the Prompt Creator, and Prompt Creator can send data back into the Video Builder.

Useful buttons:

| Button | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `Prompt Creator (Legacy)` | Shows the legacy-workflow warning before opening Prompt Creator |
| `Import Data From Prompt Creator` | Copies Prompt Creator outputs into the current builder project |
| `Send To AI Video Builder` | From Prompt Creator, saves/imports the current prompt creator project into Video Builder |
| `Send To Prompt Creator` | From Video Builder, sends audio/SRT/lyrics back to Prompt Creator so you can create concept prompts |
| `Back To AI Video Builder` | Returns to Video Builder; it is navigation, not the same as importing |
| `Prompt Options` | Opens prompt-related settings/options |
| `LLM Runner` | Opens text-only LLM/Gemma runner tools |
| `Agent` | Opens the builder assistant/agent |
| `Reference Builder` | Helps build reference material for image workflows |

Imported data can include audio, SRT, concept prompts, lyric segments, motion notes, theme/style text, story idea text, and subject/scene text.

If you manually edit Prompt Creator outputs, use the save buttons before sending/importing. The builder reads the saved files, not unsaved text sitting in a box.

If the file paths appear in the Scene tab but the scene note boxes are empty, use the matching import/reload button so the file contents are copied into the scene fields.

![Prompt Creator Import Buttons](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vrgamegirl19/comfyui-vrgamedevgirl/refs/heads/main/Workflows/LTX-2_Workflows/Video_Builder/images/Prompt%20Creator%20Import%20Buttons.png)

## Settings And Audio Notifications

Open `Settings` from the `Menu`.

Settings are project/user preferences that should carry forward between sessions when saved.

Common settings:

| Setting | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Project Video Engine | Chooses `LTX (current Builder)` or the separate `MiniMax H3` path for the whole project |
| Scene render wait limit | Chooses how many hours, from 1–24, the Builder follows each queued LTX or MiniMax scene before reporting a timeout |
| Default folder for new projects | Optional absolute parent folder used by New Project, Save Project As, and Branch Project |
| Custom model root | Optional alternate models folder root |
| Run automatic RAM/VRAM cleanup | Controls embedded cleanup nodes and automatic cache clearing between Builder jobs |
| Audio notifications | Plays a sound when selected events finish or fail |
| Notification volume | Controls notification sound volume |
| Notify on error | Plays an error sound when a run fails |
| Notify on finished item | Plays a sound after scene/image/video tasks finish |
| Notify on full run complete | Plays a sound when a batch/full build finishes |
| Custom success/error sound | Lets you choose your own audio file for notifications |

### Project Video Engine

Choose the engine before creating prompts and videos. `LTX (current Builder)` keeps the existing LTX modes and renderer. `MiniMax H3` shows the separate four-mode H3 panel, exact-timeline adapter, and H3 scene action. The value is saved with the project; older sessions without it load as LTX.

### Render Waiting

`Scene render wait limit (hours)` accepts 1–24 hours and defaults to 2. It is saved with the project and applies to newly started individual or batch scene renders for both LTX and MiniMax. Reaching this limit only stops the Builder from polling that scene; it does not cancel a render that is still active in the ComfyUI queue. Let the queue finish and use `Recover Scene Videos` when necessary.

### Project Storage

`Default folder for new projects` is optional. Use `Choose Folder`, or enter a full absolute folder path such as:

```text
D:\VRGDG Projects
```

Click `Save Projects Root` to use it for future `New Project`, `Save Project As`, and `Branch Project` operations. `Use ComfyUI Output` clears the preference. The Builder never moves an existing project or redirects ComfyUI's temporary render output when this changes. An explicit full path entered for a new project still wins for that one project. For safety, projects outside ComfyUI output are read/load capable but cannot be deleted from the Builder project picker.

### Custom Model Root

Use this if your models are not inside the normal ComfyUI `models` folder.

Example:

```text
H:\AIStuff\models
```

Inside that folder, keep the normal ComfyUI model subfolders:

```text
models
  diffusion_models
  text_encoders
  vae
  LLM
  upscale_models
  latent_upscale_models
```

The model pickers look inside the configured root and its known subfolders. If a model is not visible after changing this setting, save settings and refresh/restart the UI.

### Memory Management

`Run automatic RAM/VRAM cleanup` controls whether the Builder executes embedded `RAMCleanup`/`VRAMCleanup` nodes and directly clears Comfy/Gemma caches between tasks, retries, errors, and stops. It is off by default and off is recommended when ComfyUI DynamicVRAM is enabled. The manual `Clear Memory` top-bar action remains available in either state.

If memory usage grows during a long build, first check whether DynamicVRAM is active. Avoid enabling two competing cleanup strategies without testing a short scene; explicit cleanup can add reload time between renders.

### Audio Notifications

Audio notifications are optional. They are useful for long overnight runs.

Use them for:

- errors
- each finished scene/image/video
- full build completion
- custom success/failure sounds

Browsers may block sound until you have clicked somewhere in the page at least once.

To save settings:

1. Open `Menu` -> `Settings`.
2. Change only the options you need.
3. Choose the project engine before starting engine-specific prompt/render work.
4. For custom project storage, choose an absolute parent folder and click `Save Projects Root`.
5. For a custom model root, enter the folder that contains the normal ComfyUI model subfolders.
6. Set automatic memory cleanup according to your DynamicVRAM setup.
7. For notifications, enable the desired events, set a low test volume, and optionally choose success/error audio files.
8. Save/close Settings.
9. Refresh or restart ComfyUI when model paths changed; click once inside the browser before testing notification sounds.

## Required Custom Nodes

The Builder UI comes from this repo, but the hidden workflows it launches also use several external custom-node packs. Install these before running full image/video builds.

This list was checked against the hidden workflow templates used by the Builder and Prompt Creator, including the ZImage, Krea 2, Ernie, Flux/Klein, Nano B, Enhance, LTX I2V/T2V/reference modes, MiniMax H3 input-audio/built-in-audio modes, Ingredients, ID-LoRA, FLF, Face Fix, cleanup, transcription, and Prompt Creator workflows.

Use ComfyUI Manager when possible: open `Manager` -> `Install Custom Nodes`, search the name, install it, then restart ComfyUI. If a workflow still opens with red missing nodes, use ComfyUI Manager's missing-node installer on that workflow.

Core requirement:

| Custom node pack | Needed for |
| --- | --- |
| `comfyui-vrgamedevgirl` | The Video Builder UI, Prompt Creator, Storyboard Builder, lyric tools, VRGDG audio/SRT/project nodes, NanoBanana node, LUT/post-process helpers, and VRGDG workflow glue |

Hidden workflow requirements:

| Custom node pack | Needed for |
| --- | --- |
| `ComfyUI-VideoHelperSuite` | Loading audio/video/image paths and combining video outputs. Look for nodes such as `VHS_LoadAudio`, `VHS_LoadVideo`, and `VHS_VideoCombine` |
| `ComfyUI-LTXVideo` | LTX 2.3 video, audio VAE, I2V/T2V, Reference-to-Video, Ingredients-to-Video, latent upscaling, and LTX guide/reference nodes |
| `ComfyUI-GGUF` | GGUF model loading for video/text models. Look for nodes such as `UnetLoaderGGUF` and `DualCLIPLoaderGGUF` |
| `ComfyUI-KJNodes` | Utility image/video nodes used by the hidden workflows, including resize, image size/count, and KJ VAE loader helpers |
| `comfyui_memory_cleanup` | RAM/VRAM cleanup nodes used between heavy video and image passes. Look for `RAMCleanup` and `VRAMCleanup` |
| `erosdiffusion-eulerflowmatchingdiscretescheduler` | Custom FlowMatch scheduler used by ZImage/Krea-style image workflows. Look for `FlowMatchEulerDiscreteScheduler (Custom)` |

Mode-specific notes:

| Builder feature | Extra dependency notes |
| --- | --- |
| `Image to Video` / `Text to Video` | Requires the LTXVideo, VideoHelperSuite, GGUF, and KJNodes packs above |
| `MiniMax H3` | Requires a current ComfyUI build with `MiniMaxH3ReferenceToVideo`, KJNodes for the standard diffusion loader, VideoHelperSuite for reference video/audio loading and combining, and this repo's H3 timing/audio/reference nodes. Built-in audio also uses the installed LTX audio VAE decode node. GGUF is not supported on this path. |
| `MiniMax-H3 Turbo` | Optional. Requires `ComfyUI-MiniMax-H3-Turbo`, the selected Turbo LoRA under `models/loras`, and a ComfyUI restart after installation/update. Standard MiniMax does not require this extension while Turbo is disabled. |
| `First Last Frame` | Requires the same LTX stack plus the bundled `LTX2.3_FLF_API.json` hidden workflow and both start/end images |
| `ID-LoRA I2V` | Requires LTXVideo plus the required ID-LoRA/model shown in the Video tab |
| `Reference to Video` | Requires LTXVideo plus the MSR LoRA/model files shown in `Download Models` |
| `Ingredients to Video` | Requires LTXVideo plus the required Ingredients LoRA and Ingredients workflow files |
| `Face Fix` | Uses the bundled OpenCV face detectors, Z-Enhance, LTX 2.3, FFmpeg, and `LTX2.3_FaceFixV1_API.json`; install this repo's `requirements.txt` so `opencv-python` is available |
| `Browser AI` / Start Image Storyboard | Automated mode needs Node.js/Playwright browser setup and a logged-in supported provider; the manual browser handoff remains available when automation cannot be used |
| `ZImage`, `Flux/Klein`, `Ernie`, `Krea 2` | Use the model files in `Download Models`; if a hidden workflow reports a missing node, run Manager's missing-node installer for that workflow |
| `Nano B` | Uses the VRGDG NanoBanana node in this repo and requires the API key/model setting in the Nano B tab |
| `Prompt Creator` / lyric transcription | Uses this repo's VRGDG lyric/SRT nodes and the Python packages from `requirements.txt`; Whisper/transcription also needs the matching models and packages available in your ComfyUI environment |

Quick missing-node checklist:

1. Restart ComfyUI after installing custom nodes.
2. Open ComfyUI Manager and use `Install Missing Custom Nodes` if any hidden workflow reports missing classes.
3. Check the browser console or ComfyUI terminal for the exact missing `class_type`.
4. Install the missing pack, restart, then reopen the Builder.

## Models and Downloads

Use `Download Models` in the top bar if you need model links and folder locations. The window is organized into `LTX + Image Models`, `LLM Models`, and `MiniMax H3` tabs so each engine's required files stay together.

The model download window includes groups for:

| Model group | Used by |
| --- | --- |
| `LLM / Vision` | Gemma text and vision prompt creation |
| `ZImage` | ZImage generation |
| `Flux/Klein 9B` | Higher quality Flux/Klein generation |
| `Flux/Klein 4B` | Smaller/lighter Flux/Klein generation |
| `Ernie Image` | Ernie image generation |
| `LTX 2.3` | Video generation |
| `MiniMax H3` | MiniMax H3 diffusion model, Qwen3-VL text encoder, video VAE, and audio VAE |

After placing models in the correct ComfyUI model folders, restart ComfyUI if dropdowns do not refresh.

Folder examples:

ZImage:

```text
ComfyUI/
  models/
    text_encoders/qwen_3_4b.safetensors
    diffusion_models/z_image_turbo_bf16.safetensors
    vae/ae.safetensors
```

Flux/Klein 9B:

```text
ComfyUI/
  models/
    diffusion_models/flux-2-klein-9b-fp8.safetensors
    text_encoders/qwen_3_8b_fp8mixed.safetensors
    vae/full_encoder_small_decoder.safetensors
```

Flux/Klein 4B:

```text
ComfyUI/
  models/
    diffusion_models/flux-2-klein-4b-fp8.safetensors
    text_encoders/qwen_3_4b.safetensors
    vae/flux2-vae.safetensors
```

LTX 2.3:

```text
ComfyUI/
  models/
    diffusion_models/ltx-2.3-distilled_1.1-Q6_k.gguf
    text_encoders/ltx-2.3-text_projection_bf16.safetensors
    text_encoders/abliterated-sikaworld-high-fidelity-edition.safetensors
    vae/LTX2.3_video_vae_bf16.safetensors
    vae/LTX2.3_audio_vae_bf16.safetensors
    latent_upscale_models/ltx-2.3-spatial-upscaler-x2-1.1.safetensors
```

MiniMax H3:

```text
ComfyUI/
  models/
    diffusion_models/minimax_h3_ref2va_pruned_int8_convrot.safetensors
    text_encoders/qwen3vl_32b_minimax_h3_nvfp4_awq.safetensors
    vae/minimax_h3_video_vae_fp16.safetensors
    vae/minimax_h3_audio_vae_fp32.safetensors
```

The `MiniMax H3` tab in `Download Models` links each of these four required files and its `Folders` button shows the same directory structure. The MiniMax diffusion picker intentionally lists non-GGUF files only. If the H3 model or `MiniMaxH3ReferenceToVideo` node is missing after placing the files, update ComfyUI, restart it completely, and hard refresh the browser.

![Download Models Window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vrgamegirl19/comfyui-vrgamedevgirl/refs/heads/main/Workflows/LTX-2_Workflows/Video_Builder/images/2026-06-01%2016_02_27-.png)

## Saving Projects

Use `Quick Save` often. Keep `Auto save` on unless you have a reason to turn it off.

Use `Save Project As` before major experiments. This creates a separate copy so you can test new prompts, models, or remake settings without damaging the original project.

Use `Branch Project...` when you want the experiment recorded as a project branch, or `Export Shareable Project ZIP` when the project must be moved or shared. Project ZIP import rebases saved media paths to the extracted destination before loading the session.

By default, new/copy/branch folders are created under ComfyUI output. `Menu` -> `Settings` -> `Project Storage` can set a different absolute parent folder for future projects. This preference never relocates the currently loaded project. External project folders cannot be deleted through the Builder UI.

Project folders may contain:

| Folder or file | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `vrgdg_builder_session.json` | Main builder session |
| `builder_segments.srt` | Scene timing |
| `SceneNotes.json` | Scene notes export |
| `project_context` | Theme, story, subject, and prompt context files |
| `zimage_approved` | Approved/generated scene images |
| `scene_image_previews` | Image preview versions |
| `scene_audio` | Per-scene audio |
| `rendered_scene_videos` | Generated scene videos |
| `prompts` | Prompt and lyric segment files |

## Reference-to-Video (MSR LoRA) Video Quick-Start Walkthrough

This eight-part walkthrough follows a new project from placing the Builder node through Storyboard planning and final rendering. GitHub does not preview repository MP4s in its normal file viewer, so each title below uses the raw file URL to open or download the actual video.

12. Run `Gemma I2V All` or `Build Full Video`.
13. Stitch or build the final video.

### Legacy Prompt Creator Workflow

Use this only for an older Prompt Creator project or when you specifically need its file-based concept prompt and motion-note package.

1. Open Prompt Creator.
2. Add audio and full lyrics.
3. Run the prompt creator pipeline.
4. Review/edit concept prompts and motion notes.
5. Click `Send To AI Video Builder`.
6. In Video Builder, verify scenes, notes, prompts, audio, and SRT timing.
7. Generate images and videos.

### First Last Frame Workflow

Use this when each scene needs a planned visual destination or continuous handoff.

1. Create/load a project, audio, scenes, lyric mapping, and Reference Builder mappings.
2. Choose `Video` -> `First Last Frame`.
3. In First/Last Frame settings, choose `Chained` for continuous shared endpoints or `Independent pairs` for separate start/end images.
4. Use `Image All` and choose the matching FLF resume action.
5. Review the start/end images and final FLF prompts; repair individual scenes from their endpoint panel if needed.
6. Use `Render All` after the endpoints are approved, or `Build Full FLF Video` to finish missing FLF dependencies and stitch automatically.
7. Prefer resume choices until you intentionally want to replace completed work.

### MiniMax H3 Music Video Workflow

Use this when a finished song or spoken track must drive H3 with exact timeline timing.

1. Create or branch a project, then choose `Menu` -> `Settings` -> `Project Video Engine` -> `MiniMax H3`.
2. Load project audio and create/review timeline scenes. Keep each scene at or below about 15 seconds.
3. Choose `Input Audio (exact supplied audio)` in the MiniMax Video Settings.
4. Add and map Reference Builder characters/locations when using Reference-to-Video, or add source videos when using Video-to-Video.
5. Choose the H3 mode and settings globally. Lock only the scenes that need different settings.
6. Create/review the separate MiniMax prompt for a representative scene, then click `Create MiniMax H3 Scene Video`.
7. Confirm lip sync, reference order, exact start/end duration, and original audio before using `LLM Video All` and `Render All`.

### MiniMax H3 Short Film Workflow

Use this when MiniMax should generate the dialogue voices and scene sound.

1. Select MiniMax H3, set `Video Type` to `Speaking (short film)`, and choose `Built-in MiniMax Audio`.
2. In Reference Builder, create the film characters, choose each character's built-in/custom voice, add locations, and save.
3. Open Storyboard Builder and choose `Guided Film Automation` or `Fully Custom`.
4. For an existing script, open `Import Script / Script Mapper`, validate every cue, map every speaker, and activate the exact script.
5. Develop the storyboard, review visual actions and ordered speaker assignments, then click `Create Timeline Segments`.
6. Create and test one H3 prompt/video, then run the missing-only prompt and render batches.
7. Review every scene's generated audio and trim before final stitching.

### Recommended Video Builder Workflow

Use this for new projects.

1. Add audio.
2. Create or import the timeline scenes.
3. Open Storyboard Builder to review or refine the shared story layer, story beats, references, image defaults, motion defaults, and individual scene cards.
4. Run the image and video prompt tools, review the results, and generate media.

## Common Problems

| Problem | What to check |
| --- | --- |
| No scene is editable | Select a scene from the left list or timeline |
| The Image/Video/Audio tabs are disabled | No scene is selected |
| Model dropdowns are empty | Install models, then restart ComfyUI |
| MiniMax H3 is not shown in the Video tab | Open `Menu` -> `Settings`, set the whole project's Video Engine to `MiniMax H3`, save, and reselect the scene |
| MiniMax diffusion model is missing from the picker | H3 uses non-GGUF diffusion models only. Place the `.safetensors` model in `models/diffusion_models`, restart ComfyUI, and hard refresh |
| MiniMax Turbo reports missing/incompatible nodes | Install or update `ComfyUI-MiniMax-H3-Turbo`, restart ComfyUI, and confirm the extension's nodes load without red errors |
| MiniMax Turbo LoRA is missing | Put the selected Turbo LoRA in `ComfyUI/models/loras`, refresh the picker or restart ComfyUI, and verify the exact filename selected in Turbo acceleration |
| MiniMax reports a scene is too long | Split the scene so each H3 range is about 15 seconds or shorter; H3 is fixed at 24 FPS and a maximum 362-frame render |
| MiniMax references are missing or in the wrong order | Save Reference Builder, reopen the scene's H3 reference chooser, and check the numbered image/video order plus any slot reserved for exact-start continuity |
| A prompt-only scene image appears as MiniMax `Image 1` | Regenerate the MiniMax prompt after selecting an LLM-only environment inspiration mode. Prompt-only images never go to the renderer and must not consume or shift renderer Image N labels. |
| Character references change the start-frame clothing/body | With `Exact start frame` active, choose `Face + hair only`, save, and regenerate the MiniMax prompt. The start image then remains authoritative for clothing, body, pose, composition, lighting, and environment. |
| MiniMax exact start is unavailable | A scene image exact start and previous-final-frame exact start cannot both be active; choose one exact-start source |
| MiniMax Input Audio cannot edit speaker cues | This is intentional because typed changes would not match the supplied waveform. Choose Built-in MiniMax Audio for generated dialogue |
| MiniMax Script Mapper will not activate | Use `speaker: dialogue` or supported JSON, fix every parse error, and map every speaker to a saved Reference Builder character |
| MiniMax Render All uses the wrong mode | Check whether the scene has custom MiniMax settings locked. Unlock it to follow the current global mode, or update the locked scene settings |
| A character still sings in a MiniMax B-roll scene | Confirm `B-roll / no lip-sync` is saved in Line Mapping, then regenerate the prompt or render again. The renderer now reapplies the visual-only contract even to an older saved prompt; Input Audio vocals remain audible only as off-screen soundtrack. |
| MiniMax final clip timing is wrong | Confirm the timeline scene itself has valid start/end times and stays inside the source audio; H3 renders extra aligned frames but the Builder should trim back to the exact scene duration |
| MiniMax prompt has too many/few cuts | Check Storyboard `Cut frequency`, regenerate the prompt, and verify the exact calculated `CUT TO` count. Set it to 0 for one continuous uninterrupted take. |
| Gemma prompt buttons fail | Make sure the correct Gemma model and mmproj are selected |
| Storyboard Gemma reports a 10-minute timeout | Check the ComfyUI queue and console before retrying; the backend may still be finishing the request. Lower context/output size or use a faster runner if one scene regularly exceeds the limit. |
| Storyboard Gemma says the backend connection was lost | Confirm ComfyUI is still running and inspect the terminal for an out-of-memory/model-load crash. For Gemma Local, reduce GPU layers or context size and try one scene before restarting the full batch. |
| NanoBanana fails | Add the API key in the Nano B `Models` tab |
| Render All skips scenes | Scenes with selected videos may already be complete |
| Build Full Video replaced too much | Next time choose `Resume missing only` or a "keep prompts" option |
| Build Full FLF is unavailable | Choose `First Last Frame` in the Video tab and save the project first |
| Independent FLF scene is not ready | Confirm it has a start image, motion plan, end image, and final two-image FLF prompt; `Build Independent Start + End Pairs` can resume missing stages |
| FLF chain starts from the wrong visual | Check `Global actual chained render start` and choose the previous assigned end image or extracted rendered frame |
| Audio does not play | Check whether the project uses Global Audio or Scene Audio |
| A silent project cannot render or has no usable duration | Choose `No audio / silent timeline`, enter a duration, and click `Create Silent Audio` |
| An overlay does not appear in preview or the final stitch | Turn `Overlay Track` on and confirm the clip's eye icon is enabled; saved overlays are intentionally ignored while the track is off |
| An overlay cannot move or trim | Unlock the overlay first and make sure the edit will not overlap another enabled overlay |
| Beat markers drift over time | Run `Tools` -> `Beat Calibration...` and use three-point marker warp or an even/auto-BPM grid |
| CapCut beat import finds no match | Make sure the newest CapCut project contains beat data and its audio duration is within the matching tolerance |
| Timing changed after import | Enable `Freeze SRT timing` on scenes you do not want changed |
| Image-to-video prompt looks wrong | Turn `Use image reference for I2V prompt?` on/off depending on whether the image should guide Gemma |
| Characters sing during instrumental sections | Mark the scene `Instrumental` or `B-roll / no lip-sync`, then save lyric mapping |
| Existing-scene transcription misses or shifts lyrics | Confirm the complete reference lyrics are pasted, use `Replace All`, restart ComfyUI after updating, and listen through boundary scenes in lyric review |
| Cyrillic lyrics create empty two-second scenes from 0:00 | Update/restart the Builder, then rerun reference-lyric transcription with `Replace All`; lyric normalization now preserves Unicode letters |
| Beat mode created scenes but lyrics are blank | Beat mode now transcribes its finished scenes automatically; confirm reference lyrics were supplied and review the transcription error/progress window |
| Wrong singer performs a duet line | Open `Review Lines + Map Performers`, check both singers, then save |
| A dialogue prompt talks about singing | Set the top-bar `Video Type` to `Speaking (short film)`, map the correct speaker, and regenerate the prompt |
| Lyric notes do not show on the timeline | Use `Show Lyric Notes`, then save the lyric review |
| Location dropdowns are empty | Add locations in Reference Builder and save it |
| Reference Builder auto map fails | Extract/add locations first, then auto map; reduce overly long location lists if needed |
| Ingredients tabs are blank | Update to the newest Builder, restart ComfyUI, and hard refresh the browser so the repaired Sheets, Mapping, and Locations panels load |
| Story Arc reports a changed lyric structure | Update and rerun. Trailing invented headings are removed automatically; a remaining error means Gemma actually missed, renamed, reordered, or inserted a heading inside the required structure |
| Render All progress disappeared | Reopen the persistent render log and inspect the saved JSON/text report in the project for completed phases, failures, and stitch timing |
| A scene render reports the wait limit | Open `Menu` -> `Settings` -> `Render Waiting` and increase `Scene render wait limit (hours)` up to 24. If ComfyUI is still rendering, let it finish and then use scene-video recovery/history; also inspect the terminal and temporary output before retrying |
| `Delete ALL Videos` cleared the timeline | The underlying video/thumbnail files were intentionally left in the project folder. Reassign or recover the desired file; unlike `Delete ALL Images`, this action does not delete media files. |
| Prompt Creator data does not populate notes | Use `Send To AI Video Builder` or `Import Data From Prompt Creator`, then reload/import prompt files if needed |
| LM Studio is selected but a pass says Built-in GGUF | That job is explicitly local-only, or the selected LM Studio model cannot serve the required path. Supported text/vision jobs name LM Studio in progress; test the server/model and use a vision-capable model for image-reference work. |
| Browser AI cannot control the browser | Run Install/Check Browser Setup, sign in with `Open Selected Login`, or use the manual export/import path |
| Face Fix finds no face | Choose a clearer description frame, lower minimum face pixels, adjust confidence/rotation assist, or pick a repair-distance preset that includes the face size |
| Updater stops | Local edits or a non-fast-forward branch can block the safe updater; save/back up your work and use the manual Git commands to inspect the conflict |
| Project ZIP import fails | Keep ComfyUI running, confirm the archive came from `Export Shareable Project ZIP`, and check the terminal for extraction/path validation errors |
| A project outside ComfyUI output cannot be deleted in the picker | This safety restriction is intentional. Verify the full external path and remove it manually outside the Builder if desired |
| Audio notification does not play | Click inside the browser once and check notification settings |
| Model path is wrong on Linux | Use forward slashes and make sure the model picker shows the exact model name |
