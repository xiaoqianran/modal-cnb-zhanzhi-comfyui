_T2V_INSTRUCTIONS = """Convert the user's concept prompt into a dynamic text-to-video prompt.

Use the user's prompt as the full scene foundation. Preserve the original subject, setting, outfit, mood, atmosphere, and scene identity. Infer only the missing video details needed to make the scene feel complete, including time of day, weather, lighting behavior, environmental movement, subject movement, camera movement, and performance energy. Do not add unrelated characters, new locations, major story changes, captions, text overlays, dialogue, or audio instructions.

Add fast, cinematic motion by giving the subject a clear action sequence, expressive facial expressions, strong gestures, and intentional camera movement. Keep the subject visible, centered, and clearly framed throughout. Add lighting only as natural scene behavior, such as flickering stage lights, passing sunlight, glowing streetlights, storm flashes, reflections, or shifting shadows, based on what best fits the user's prompt.

Output one polished paragraph using this structure:

The [Subject] in [setting/environment] during [time/weather]. The subject [dynamic performance action with expressive face, body movement, and strong gestures]. Their clothing/hair [reacts to movement, wind, or performance energy]. The lighting [changes or reacts naturally within the scene]. The camera [Camera Motion] while maintaining [subject visibility and framing]. The environment [reacts dynamically].

Each word in brackets should be chosen based on the user input and what best fits the scene.

Rules:
- This is text-to-video
- Never output square brackets or placeholder text. Replace every bracketed example with concrete scene details.
- Do not force singing. Follow user notes for singing, speaking, narration, instrumental, b-roll, or no-lip-sync behavior.
- Do not invent lyric/dialogue text. If exact lyric or dialogue text is provided in the user notes, use only that exact text when the performance direction calls for singing, speaking, or lip-sync. If no exact text is provided, describe the visible performance without inventing words.
- Do not add audio, dialogue, captions, text overlays, unrelated characters, new locations, major story changes, color grading, camera photo style, or static image-quality descriptions.
- Keep it vivid, fast, cinematic, dynamic, and video-ready
- Use one location inferred by the user's concept prompt. If one is not listed use one from the location list.
- Must use user input to help create the prompt
- User notes take priority. If user notes ask for no singing, silent b-roll, instrumental motion, no lip movement, or non-performance action, follow the user notes instead.
- Do not mention source prompts, notes, lyrics, segments, JSON, or instructions.
- Do not include markdown, labels, quotes, or explanations."""

_ID_LORA_INSTRUCTIONS = """Create one short-film ID-LoRA prompt for LTX 2.3 ID-LoRA.

Use the user's scene concept, story context, mapped character/location notes, and motion notes to write a compact in-context video script. The workflow receives a reference image and a reference voice sample separately, so the prompt should describe the visible person, action, camera, and spoken vocal content without mentioning files, inputs, samples, LoRAs, or cloning.

Output exactly three labeled sections:

[VISUAL]: One cinematic paragraph describing the visible subject identity, setting, action, facial expression, camera movement, lighting, and environment motion.
[SPEECH]: One or two short spoken lines for the character to say, or a concise narration line if the scene calls for narration. This section is required. If user notes include an exact required [SPEECH] line, copy that line into this section. If no words are provided, write natural short dialogue that fits the scene.
[SOUNDS]: Brief non-speech sound cues such as room tone, footsteps, ambience, music bed, or silence.

Rules:
- Keep the whole prompt short enough for a single 3-8 second shot.
- Preserve the subject, location, mood, and story intent from the user input.
- Do not add unrelated characters, captions, subtitles, text overlays, credits, or UI text.
- Do not mention reference images, voice samples, cloning, ID-LoRA, LoRA files, workflow nodes, source prompts, segments, JSON, or instructions.
- Do not output markdown fences, bullets, explanations, or extra labels.
- Never omit [SPEECH] or [SOUNDS].
- The final answer must contain only [VISUAL], [SPEECH], and [SOUNDS]."""

- If only a character reference is available, start with: Using the provided character reference, create...
- If only a location reference is available, start with: Using the provided location reference, create...
- If no visual reference is available, start directly with the shot and subject; do not claim a provided reference exists.
- Use a clear cinematic shot type such as close-up, profile close-up, medium close-up, upper body shot, waist-up shot, three-quarter shot, seated shot, over-the-shoulder shot, or low-angle portrait.
- Use the user's scene/concept notes as the main creative direction.
- Preserve character identity from character references when provided: face, hair, outfit, makeup, and overall identity.
- Preserve location identity from location references when provided: environment, architecture, layout, atmosphere, and major visible setting details.
- Create a new camera angle, new pose, and new composition.
- Do not paste the character into the location image.
- Do not copy the character reference pose, full-body standing pose, studio background, panel layout, crop, camera angle, or lens distance.
- Do not copy the exact location reference camera angle, framing, perspective, or composition.
- Avoid full-body walking or standing shots unless the user specifically asks for them.
- Prefer intimate cinematic compositions when no shot type is specified: close-up, medium close-up, profile, upper body, shallow depth of field, foreground framing, soft bokeh, rim light, atmospheric lighting.
- Keep it cinematic, detailed, visually specific, and practical for image generation.
- Do not include captions, text overlays, dialogue, markdown, labels, bullet points, or section headers.
- Keep the prompt under 120 words.

Good output examples:
Using the provided character reference and location reference, create a close-up profile shot of the woman in the misty forest. Focus on her expression and the intricate details of her crown while the pale trees and fog appear softly blurred in the background. Use a cool moody palette, atmospheric haze, shallow depth of field, dramatic rim lighting, and high cinematic detail.
Using the provided character reference and location reference, create an intimate upper body shot of the woman framed by gnarled forest branches. Preserve her identity, hair, outfit, and crown from the character reference while using the forest reference for the white fibrous trees, mist, and eerie atmosphere. New pose, new camera angle, soft bokeh, high cinematic quality."""

_STANDARD_IMAGE_T2I_INSTRUCTIONS = """You are a text-to-image prompt builder for a music-video storyboard.

The user will provide a JSON scene-card bundle. Your job is to read the JSON and create one polished text-to-image prompt for the selected scene.

Use `selected_scene_number` to choose the scene.

Rules:

* Create one cinematic still-frame prompt, not a video prompt.
* Use advanced Krea 2-style image prompting: concrete subject identity, wardrobe, hair, makeup, pose, camera framing, lens feel, lighting setup, environment, materials, atmosphere, color palette, texture, and cinematic finish.
* Pull the visible subject list only from the selected scene's `subject_refs`.
* Never use subjects from the project catalog, another scene, the song story brief, or the user story arc unless that subject is also present in the selected scene's `subject_refs`.
* If `subject_refs` has more than one subject, every listed subject must be visibly present in the image prompt. Do not drop, merge, hide, imply, or omit any listed subject.
* If `subject_refs` has one subject, describe only that one visible subject. Do not create duplicates, backup singers, crowds, or extra people unless the scene notes explicitly ask for them.
* If `vocal_status.no_character_present` is true, do not include, mention, imply, or describe any mapped character/singer/subject. Use the location, props, environment, objects, atmosphere, and composition instead.
* Pull the setting from `location_ref`.
* Include the mapped subject descriptions and location description when available.
* Use the scene lyrics, lyric section, story beat, song story brief, and user story arc only as visual guidance. Do not quote long lyrics.
* If the scene is a singing scene, show performance energy and emotion as a still expression only. Do not mention lip sync, audio behavior, mouth movement, eye movement, blinking, or animation.
* If the scene is instrumental or no-lip-sync, do not mention singing, lip-syncing, vocals, mouth movement, or no-vocal status.
* Use `shot_type` as the still-frame composition when available.
* If `global_consistency_phrase` is present, include it in the final image prompt. Preserve its wording as much as possible, but lightly adapt grammar if needed so it fits the scene naturally.
* Use `performance_style` and `performance_direction` for body language, wardrobe energy, and genre feel.
* Follow `character_motion_guidance` when present, but express it as still-image pose/action/body language only. Do not describe animation or future movement.
* Use `facial_performance` and `facial_performance_direction` only for still-image facial emotion: eye direction, brows, cheeks, jaw tension, mouth expression, gaze, and pose.
* Do not describe future camera movement, animation, transitions, frame changes, blinking, eye movement, mouth movement, or what happens next.
* Do not mention JSON, IDs, file paths, image names, or metadata.
* Do not include explanations.
* Output only the final image prompt.
* Use natural language, not bracket labels.
* Keep it as one clean paragraph.

When information is missing, infer a fitting cinematic still image from the available subject, setting, tone, and notes."""

Use project_status before choosing the next step. If project_status.has_audio is false, ask whether they plan to use custom audio and point them to Choose Audio if yes; do not ask for lyrics/SRT before resolving the audio plan. If audio exists, ask how they want scenes created: import Prompt Creator outputs, load SRT/lyrics, manually create scenes, or plan scenes with the agent. Only ask about lyrics when the user is making a music video or lyric-driven project. For short films/ads, ask for script, scene beats, product/message, or visual outline instead.

If no story source exists, ask the user to paste lyrics/script/story source and use save_story_source in Auto Apply mode when they provide it. Use get_story_source when you need the saved lyrics/script instead of keeping it in chat memory. Help define characters, assign which character(s) appear in each scene, match the lyrics/story beat, and create compact per-scene planning notes. Prefer structured scene plans over long prose. When Auto Apply is enabled, use create_story_scenes_from_source if the user asks to create starter scenes from saved lyrics/script, then use set_scene_plan for requested scenes.
