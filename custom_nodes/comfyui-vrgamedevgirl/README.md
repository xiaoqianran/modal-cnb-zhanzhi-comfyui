# 🎮 VRGameDevGirl’s AI Video, Image & Creative Workflow Nodes for ComfyUI

A growing collection of custom ComfyUI nodes for **AI video creation, music videos, storyboarding, image generation, video enhancement, face repair, editing, LoRA training, and workflow automation**.

The flagship tool is the **AI Video Builder**: a scene-by-scene production workspace for LTX 2.3, MiniMax H3, and future video engines that brings planning, prompting, media generation, timing, review, and final assembly together inside ComfyUI.

- 🔗 Build chained or independent First/Last Frame sequences for stronger continuity.
- 🗣️ Review lyrics, map singers, plan lip-sync scenes, and mark instrumental or B-roll sections.
- ✨ Repair faces, enhance clips, apply post-processing, and compare results.
- 🎚️ Preview timing on the visual timeline, calibrate beat markers, and stitch the final video.
- 💾 Save, branch, export, import, and continue portable Builder projects.

## 💡 Good to Know

- The **Video Builder guide** is the main source for setup, model paths, screenshots, and step-by-step help.
- Start with a short project or a few scenes before committing to a long render.
- Save often, and use **Branch Project** or **Export Shareable Project ZIP** before major experiments.
- Optional training, Browser AI, face-repair, and enhancement tools may have their own setup requirements.
