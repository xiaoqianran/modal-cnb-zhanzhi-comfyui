# Changelog

## v1.4.2

- Adds a local custom-API host allow-list, validates every outbound prompt-API request, and blocks redirects to unvalidated destinations.
- Restricts Easy H3 settings, model-discovery, prompt-optimization, and LoRA-list routes to the local ComfyUI host.
- Documents the allow-list in the Settings UI and both READMEs.
- Uses English as the backend/default node-language fallback and completes native ComfyUI `locales/en` and `locales/zh` definitions for the Remix Loader and Digital Human/MV Duration Crop.

## v1.4.1

- Adds a play/stop control beside each reference-audio trim range. Preview playback starts at the normalized trim start, stops at the trim end, and never changes the source file or the audio sent to H3.

## v1.4.0

- Adds **Digital human/MV auto duration**. When enabled, Audio 1's trimmed duration controls generation and locks the manual duration field.
- Adds **FeiHou Easy H3 Digital human/MV Duration Crop** and a matching `duration_control` output on FeiHou Easy H3 Output. H3 now rounds automatic-duration sampling up to its required `5 + 17N` frame count; the crop node restores the precise trimmed-audio duration after decoding, while passing ordinary workflows through unchanged.

## v1.3.12

- Adds per-slot **reference-audio trimming** below the embedded Audio 1–3 gallery. Start and end are separate fields; ranges are saved with their audio when reordered. Times accept forgiving input and normalize to 100ms precision (`MM:SS:MMM`); trimming affects only the temporary H3 audio payload, never the uploaded source file.
- Adds **CLIP** and trimmed **Audio 1** outputs to FeiHou Easy H3 Output. They are appended after existing outputs so saved workflow links keep their original slot positions.
- Aligns the reference-image **Match generation size** rule with the official H3 node's downscale-only output-pixel-area behavior. When an I2V/FL2V workflow actually requests second-pass sampling, its shared context now uses H3's reference-to-video latent representation.
- Prevents the embedded media panel from self-expanding indefinitely in ComfyUI Modern Nodes mode.

## v1.3.11

- Fixes native ComfyUI external-input support for the embedded Easy H3 UI. Connected widgets now preserve their graph links instead of being overwritten by panel defaults during workflow serialization.
- The fix covers duration, resolution, aspect ratio, width/height, FPS, advanced settings, force offload, reference options, and prompt-optimizer controls. Embedded image/video/audio uploads and ordering are unchanged.

## v1.3.10

- Adds **FeiHou Easy H3 Remix Loader**: FL2VA and REF2VA share one Remix transformer, while first-pass and second-pass LoRA stacks remain independent. The optional second-pass model selector now uses **None** to keep the normal model path.
- Adds an Ollama-only **Disable thinking** setting. When enabled, Easy H3 sends the native Ollama `think: false` request option.
- Adds non-blocking **complete low-VRAM streamed-block conflict diagnostics**. When that experimental switch is enabled, existing H3 block, output-head, and attention patches are reported in the console before generation continues.

## v1.3.9

- **Force offload** now also runs a one-time ComfyUI-native allocator cleanup immediately after each sampler returns and before VAE decoding. It releases only unused cached memory; it does not clear memory during denoising steps.
- Replaces the attention-only experiment with optional **Complete low-VRAM streamed blocks (experimental)**. The embedded GPL-3.0-or-later-derived MAINodes implementation streams H3 QKV, attention, MLP/SwiGLU, and output-head work using exact bf16 K/V defaults. See NOTICE for attribution and license details.
- Updates the low-VRAM sample workflow to use the built-in complete block-streaming switch and removes the competing `ModelAttentionBackend / comfy kitchen attention` patch from that workflow.

## v1.3.8

- Fixes prompt-guide titles to read ComfyUI's current locale at display time rather than locking in the language during frontend module initialization.
- Adds the missing Chinese/English fallback label for **R2VA 加强版 / R2VA Enhanced**, so the guide remains correctly named while the backend scheme list is loading or when frontend cache is refreshed.

## v1.3.7

- Adds the built-in **R2VA Enhanced** prompt guide directly below “General only”. It uses the supplied six-section full-reference prompt template for complex reference-video, identity-retention, source-video, audio, and digital-human workflows.
- With **Force offload** enabled, a cached second-pass transformer from the prior workflow execution is now released before the next first-pass model is prepared, preventing the two stages from unnecessarily sharing VRAM.
- Further improves the embedded media gallery and prompt-editor responsive layout when resizing the node.

## v1.3.6

- Adds optional custom second-pass FL2VA and REF2VA model selection in the Loader, plus a dedicated second-sampling model output from the main node.
- Adds optional second-pass LoRA disabling and releases first-pass model / LoRA resources before second-pass sampling.
- Releases the text encoder and video/audio VAEs from VRAM after preprocessing and before sampling, reducing peak VRAM pressure while retaining automatic ComfyUI offload behavior.
- Adds ComfyUI-native Chinese/English node-definition translations and localizes embedded LoRA-stack and prompt-preview UI text according to the ComfyUI language setting.

## v1.3.5

- Embedded images, videos, and audio can now be dragged within their own galleries to change their reference order. The new order is saved in the workflow and used by H3 and prompt optimization.

## v1.3.4

- Fixes the “＋ Add custom API” button in ComfyUI Settings. It now creates a custom API tab directly instead of relying on a browser-native prompt dialog that some ComfyUI hosts suppress.
- Custom API cards now include an auto-saving, editable service-name field.

## v1.3.3

- Fixes FeiHou Easy H3 Loader model dropdowns retaining a stale plugin-level
  file list. Newly saved models under `models/diffusion_models` now appear the
  next time ComfyUI refreshes node definitions, without requiring a further
  server restart.

## v1.3.2

- Built-in prompt-optimization services now start with only their editable default API address; no model is preloaded or selected automatically.
- Migrates only models injected by older plugin defaults: user-added models and API keys are preserved, while an obsolete default selection is cleared.

## v1.3.1

- Fixes saved workflows failing validation while prompt optimization is disabled. Dynamic API service/model and prompt-guide selections are no longer validated against the current Settings list before the node can read the optimization switch.

## v1.3.0

- Prompt optimization now sends API-only JPEG copies of reference images, capped by the node's selected `ref_image_size` and encoded at quality 85. Original H3 media is never modified.
- Reference videos now contribute compact first, middle, and last visual keyframes to compatible prompt-optimization APIs; standalone audio and video soundtracks remain local to H3 generation.
- Adds safe prompt-API diagnostics: logs include endpoint, model, API format, and media-size summaries while redacting API keys, filenames, Base64 payloads, and media contents.

## v1.2.0

- Removes filename-based filtering from the H3 Loader. Renamed community model files are now listed from their respective ComfyUI model folders.
- Lets users manually assign the selected diffusion model, text encoder, video VAE, and audio VAE to each H3 Loader role.
- Keeps `.safetensors` and `.gguf` discovery across the relevant ComfyUI model directories.

## v1.1.0

- Fixes workflow validation when prompt optimization is disabled: the serialized service value remains valid while the optimization switch controls whether an API request is made.
- Fixes an issue where ComfyUI serializing a Boolean as the string `"false"` could still incorrectly run prompt optimization.
- Improves compatibility with saved workflows and avoids unnecessary prompt-optimization API calls when the feature is off.

## v1.0.0

- Adds a visible `modified` declaration to the main node header, including H3 source (`nkxx188/ComfyUI-MiniMaxH3-Easy`) and API source (`yawiii/ComfyUI-Prompt-Assistant`).
- Embeds up to 9 images, 3 videos, and 3 standalone audio files directly in the Easy H3 node.
- Adds the FeiHou LoRA Stack input flow for the Easy H3 Loader.
- Adds ComfyUI Settings integration for API providers, configured service/model selection, and prompt-optimization rules.
- Applies the selected prompt scheme during normal node execution, and carries the final result to H3 Context / Prompt Preview.
