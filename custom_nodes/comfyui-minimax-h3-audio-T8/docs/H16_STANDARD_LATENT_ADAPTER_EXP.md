# Standard H3 → LTX video latent candidate

Scoped completed EXP source, rebased on released v1.84.0; registered as the343rd
node after all342 existing IDs, including Sol and the two Semantic Bridge nodes.
A conversion/save template is in
`examples/workflows/35-h3-ltx-latent`; it requires local input and asset setup.
The fresh public-route refinement below is complete. The rebased candidate's
624 selected CPU tests and actual Core343 registration passed; the342-ID prefix
and all272 existing graph/Sol contents match the release with explicit LF
comparison. Formal-core delivery, actual native CPU and CUDA/BF16 latent
save/load checks and the three-clip picture/audio/lipsync human review completed.
Event/seam ratings remain NA; no universal quality or16GB guarantee follows.
See [the latest source/acceptance scope](H16_SOURCE_UPDATE_20260917.md). These test
counts are scoped, not whole-repository or end-to-end quality claims.
Do not label the existing accepted Prepared LTX clip as acceptance of this new entry.

Later progress notes below retain historical failed/pending attempts; this
header and the linked current summary supersede their status, not their evidence.

## Boundary

`MiniMaxH3LTXLatentAdapterEXPT8` takes standard Comfy LATENT, either plain H3 video
or joint H3 video/audio. It returns only LTX video LATENT, the original unmodified
H3 object, actual output frames, FPS and a report. Use the existing learned H3
upscaler upstream when needed; this node never adds a second upscaler or RGB detour.
Neither H3 audio nor masks/reference conditioning are reinterpreted as LTX inputs.

Source frames must be explicitly specified on the H3 17n+5 grid at24fps, with an
exact explicit reference prefix if present. Current temporal policies:

| Input | Policy | Output | Audio consequence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 73 | exact | 73 /24fps | No duration change |
| 124 | exact | Explicit rejection | Choose a policy, not silent crop |
| 124 | pad_to_ltx_grid | 129 /24fps | Separately extend/handle audio tail |
| 124 | crop_to_ltx_grid | 121 /24fps | Explicitly trim/reconcile audio |

The node does not mux audio or use `-shortest`. Spatial canvas stays unchanged and
must already align to32 pixels. It has no artificial source-frame ceiling.

No external code or weights are redistributed. Source files are authenticated
with LF-normalized hashes and executed from those checked bytes in a unique owned
package, without altering sys.path or importing unverified siblings/pycache.
Config/weights are checked before and after execution. Model loading preserves
the host CPU RNG. CPU/F32 is the conservative initial default; CUDA/BF16 is explicit,
not a silent fallback. Each call releases its own model and temporary modules.
Cancellation is checked between module forwards; no global model unload/cache purge.

## Evidence from the new interface

Historical GPU evidence paths below are under `artifacts/h16` in the isolated
`bridge-h16-meridian-20260917` checkout. The current rebased candidate is
`meridian-h16-resume-20260917`; its evidence is under `artifacts/resume`.

- `standard-latent-contract-cpu-v1`:58 selected tests, including overlapping
  package/workflow tests. Not a full repository test count.
- `standard-latent-actual-cpu-v1`:actual194,759,504-parameter adapter on the saved
  real73-frame H3 latent; wrapper output bit-identical to direct upstream CPU/F32.
- `standard-node-actual-cpu-v1`:actual node class with pinned owned loader,
  bit-identical to that reference; source AV and CPU RNG unchanged, modules cleaned.
- `standard-node-actual-cuda-bf16-v1`:same real input through CUDA/BF16 node;
  finite `[1,128,10,15,26]` output. Adapter peak allocated459,738,624 bytes,
  reserved528,482,304; after owned model cleanup998,400 allocated bytes (output).
  These are adapter-only allocator readings, not whole LTX pipeline requirements.
- `standard-adapter-native-ltx-decode-v1`:both outputs decoded with actual Comfy
  LTX VAE to73×480×832 RGB, encoded H264 with all97 original AAC packet payloads
  retained. Both strict video/audio checks passed. Decoded CPU/F32 vs CUDA/BF16
  MAE0.001014, PSNR55.76dB; this is numeric proximity, not human acceptance.
  VAE peak allocated5,459,514,368 bytes is separate from the adapter-only number.

One inspected frame is nonblack and contains the expected two-person indoor scene;
that does not qualify motion, likeness or refinement. No new diffusion was run.
- `registration342-cpu-v1`:106 selected CPU tests passed,1703 sources unchanged,
  CUDA not initialized. Not a full repository regression.
- `standard-node-native-core-v1`:actual native LoadLatent → registered adapter →
  native SaveLatent completed on CPU, bit-identical to direct node output.
  Native open/save/export, full-page reload and second API export were identical.
  The first visual layout overlapped outputs; layout-only v2 fixed that and was
  opened/saved/exported again. Both saved graph and actual API audit passed.
  All browser actions used an isolated CPU service; no UI injection or generation.
  Owned service exited and was cleaned. This does not qualify fresh refinement.

Next: compare through the existing refinement
route on this unaccepted short draft, then include the bound result in collective
human review. Do not regenerate or overwrite the old accepted LTX sample.

## Fresh refinement input preparation

`standard-node-LTX-audio-input-v1` completed with the actual native LTX audio VAE,
exit0 and no owned children. It consumed the previously generated CUDA/BF16
standard-node video latent without rerunning H3, the adapter or an upscaler.
The matching source AAC decoded to98304 stereo samples at32kHz; native audio
encoding returned77 latent frames, explicitly conformed to76 for the73-frame
LTX timeline. The final refiner delivery will retain the original AAC, not this
conditioning waveform or the newly refined audio. No audio loudness correction.

`standard-node-LTX-public-refinement-v1/preparation.json` binds4709 assets and
the exact Core/LTX/Sana source revisions for the existing public Prepared nodes.
The upstream fixed generic Stage2 prompt intentionally applies to new drafts;
its separately recovered, weights-only-loadable text cache was fully hashed.
No new Gemma inference is necessary. The original failed text-encoding job is
not relabelled successful; only its verified metadata recovery is reused.

Next explicit command after the current GPU owner exits:
`python -X utf8 -B artifacts/h16/run_h16_ltx_prepared.py --run`.
This calls the real public bundle and generation node classes, runs a fresh
three-update joint refiner then separate VAE decode with stage ownership/cache
checks. Preparation alone is not a successful refined clip or human acceptance.

## Fresh public-route refinement completed

The command above completed successfully in this development checkout. Do not
rerun it as though preparation were still pending. The actual public bundle and
generation nodes produced a new73-frame832×480H264 clip, SHA
`4a6142ccef579fe6c8254daaad2132ad8146b6f2d5223c35cd80357d889c11b7`.
There were three joint Euler forwards/144 block calls,22.66seconds including
weight transfers; the separately owned tiled VAE decode took4.19seconds.
These are stage measurements, not full-job latency or a speed comparison.
All97 original AAC packets and timestamps were retained, with no reencoding;
full AV decoding passed. Both generation and decode exited0 and their Windows
Job Objects had zero remaining owned processes after cleanup.

The source was the new standard-node adapter result; no H3 generation, adapter,
extra upscaler or text encoder was rerun. The refiner uses inverse-quantized
existing INT8 weights with BF16 LoRA fusion, not INT8 activation execution and
not an original BF16 checkpoint. The historical output filename contains
`learned2x`, but this test adds no second upscaler. First/middle/last frame
inspection shows nonblack two-person indoor images; motion/likeness/quality
remain for collective human review. This does not change the accepted old clip.
