# Overview

The current workflow connections are becoming increasingly dense, making them difficult to understand and operate, and there are issues with poor consistency. As the number of saved workflows increases, frequent errors occur during actual use, and the operation methods need to be relearned. To address this, a plugin has been developed to simplify workflows, clarify control concepts, and design nodes around the "Loader ---- Controller ----- Sampler" framework.

# II. Usage Guide

## 1. Universal Loader Sum_load_adv, Supports GGUF Models

1) Model combinations for various workflows are the same as official workflows.

① XL, SD mode: Load model checkpoint or Unet or over model.

② wan2.1, wan2.2, QwenEdit mode: Load model Unet + clip1

③ Flux\Kontext mode: Load model Unet + clip1 + clip2 (Note: In order, not clip1+clip3)

④ SD3.5 mode: Load model Unet+clip1 +clip2+clip3

⑤ Hi-dream mode: Load model Unet+clip1 +clip2+clip3+clip4

2) Override mode over_model and over_clip

① When using over_model, the internal corresponding model or Unet of the loader becomes invalid and will directly output model

② When using over_clip, all internal corresponding clip1,2,3,4 of the loader become invalid and will directly output clip

3) Preset saving, which can save loaded models and sampling methods uniformly

① At least one arbitrary preset must be selected, otherwise an error will occur

② After selecting any preset, all parameters can be modified and take effect arbitrarily.

③ Newly set parameters can be saved as new presets, but ComfyUI needs to be restarted to select and use them

## 2. Controller Stack: Functional modules with associated control tools centralized together

① General Control image Stack: Universal control for SD, XL, Flux, etc., Ipa style, redux transfer, Union_controlnet, controlnet_adv, inpaint redrawing

② General Control wan Stack: All wan video generation nodes officially supported

③ General Control AD Stack: Animatediff animation generation control, prompt scheduling, CN scheduling, IPA scheduling, etc.

④ General Control Kontext Stack: Multi-image reference, partitioned generation, redux transfer, union_controlnet

⑤ General Control QwenEdit Stack: Multi-image reference, union_controlnet

## 3. Sampler: Rich sampling methods to eliminate repetitive connections

① Basic sampler: Packages ComfyUI's built-in sampler input ports into a single port replacement, with functionality completely consistent with the official version

② Special function sampler: A combination of basic sampler + special functions.

As in the example below, operations like secondary sampling repair and refine enlargement can be achieved in one step:

## 4. Utility Nodes: Image, mask, data processing tools

1. Data types: Data conversion, data creation，data operation

2. Image processing: A powerful image processing combination: pre-processing, intermediate generation, and post-recovery

3. Mask processing: Creation, conversion, and transformation of masks
