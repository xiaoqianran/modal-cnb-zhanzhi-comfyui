  - Higher values = more VRAM savings but slower processing
  - Requires offload_device to be set and different from device

- **swap_io_components**: Offload input/output embeddings and normalization layers
  - Additional VRAM savings when combined with blocks_to_swap
  - Requires offload_device to be set and different from device

- **attention_mode**: Attention computation backend
  - `sdpa`: PyTorch scaled_dot_product_attention (default, always available)
  - `flash_attn_2`: Flash Attention 2 (Ampere+, requires flash-attn package)
  - `flash_attn_3`: Flash Attention 3 (Hopper+, requires flash-attn with FA3 support)
  - `sageattn_2`: SageAttention 2 (requires sageattention package)
  - `sageattn_3`: SageAttention 3 (Blackwell/RTX 50xx, requires sageattn3 package)

- **torch_compile_args**: Connect to SeedVR2 Torch Compile Settings node for 20-40% speedup

**BlockSwap Explained:**

BlockSwap enables running large models on GPUs with limited VRAM by dynamically swapping transformer blocks between GPU and CPU memory during inference.

> **Note:** BlockSwap is not available on macOS. Apple Silicon Macs use unified memory architecture where GPU and CPU share the same memory pool, making BlockSwap meaningless. The option will be automatically disabled with a warning if requested on macOS.

Here's how it works:

- **What it does**: Keeps only the currently-needed transformer blocks on the GPU, while storing the rest on CPU or another device
- **When to use it**: When you get OOM (Out of Memory) errors during the upscaling phase
- **How to configure**:
  1. Set `offload_device` to `cpu` or another GPU
  2. Start with `blocks_to_swap=16` (half the blocks)
  3. If still getting OOM, increase to 24 or 32 (3B) / 36 (7B)
  4. Enable `swap_io_components` for maximum VRAM savings
  5. If you have plenty of VRAM, decrease or set to 0 for faster processing

**Example Configuration for Low VRAM (8GB)**:
- model: `seedvr2_ema_3b-Q8_0.gguf`
- device: `cuda:0`
- offload_device: `cpu`
- blocks_to_swap: `32`
- swap_io_components: `True`

#### 2. SeedVR2 (Down)Load VAE Model

![SeedVR2 (Down)Load VAE Model](docs/vae_model_loader.png)

**Parameters:**

- **model**: VAE model selection
  - `ema_vae_fp16.safetensors`: Default and recommended

- **device**: GPU device for VAE inference (e.g., `cuda:0`)

- **offload_device**: Device to offload VAE model when not actively processing
  - `none`: Keep model on inference device (default, fastest)
  - `cpu`: Offload to system RAM (reduces VRAM)
  - `cuda:X`: Offload to another GPU (good balance if available)

- **cache_model**: Keep VAE model loaded on offload_device between workflow runs
  - Requires offload_device to be set

- **encode_tiled**: Enable tiled encoding to reduce VRAM usage during encoding phase
  - Enable if you see OOM errors during the "Encoding" phase in debug logs

- **encode_tile_size**: Encoding tile size in pixels (default: 1024)
  - Applied to both height and width
  - Lower values reduce VRAM but may increase processing time

- **encode_tile_overlap**: Encoding tile overlap in pixels (default: 128)
  - Reduces visible seams between tiles

- **decode_tiled**: Enable tiled decoding to reduce VRAM usage during decoding phase
  - Enable if you see OOM errors during the "Decoding" phase in debug logs

- **decode_tile_size**: Decoding tile size in pixels (default: 1024)

- **decode_tile_overlap**: Decoding tile overlap in pixels (default: 128)

- **torch_compile_args**: Connect to SeedVR2 Torch Compile Settings node for 15-25% speedup

**VAE Tiling Explained:**

VAE tiling processes large resolutions in smaller tiles to reduce VRAM requirements. Here's how to use it:

1. **Run without tiling first** and monitor the debug logs (enable `enable_debug` on main node)
2. **If OOM during "Encoding" phase**:
   - Enable `encode_tiled`
   - If still OOM, reduce `encode_tile_size` (try 768, 512, etc.)
3. **If OOM during "Decoding" phase**:
   - Enable `decode_tiled`
   - If still OOM, reduce `decode_tile_size`
4. **Adjust overlap** (default 128) if you see visible seams in output (increase it) or processing times are too slow (decrease it).

**Example Configuration for High Resolution (4K)**:
- encode_tiled: `True`
- encode_tile_size: `1024`
- encode_tile_overlap: `128`
- decode_tiled: `True`
- decode_tile_size: `1024`
- decode_tile_overlap: `128`

#### 3. SeedVR2 Torch Compile Settings (Optional)

![SeedVR2 Torch Compile Settings](docs/torch_compile_settings.png)

Configure torch.compile optimization for 20-40% DiT speedup and 15-25% VAE speedup.

**Requirements:**
- PyTorch 2.0+
- Triton (for inductor backend)

**Parameters:**

- **backend**: Compilation backend
  - `inductor`: Full optimization with Triton kernel generation and fusion (recommended)
  - `cudagraphs`: Lightweight wrapper using CUDA graphs, no kernel optimization

- **mode**: Optimization level (compilation time vs runtime performance)
  - `default`: Fast compilation with good speedup (recommended for development)
  - `reduce-overhead`: Lower overhead, optimized for smaller models
  - `max-autotune`: Slowest compilation, best runtime performance (recommended for production)
  - `max-autotune-no-cudagraphs`: Like max-autotune but without CUDA graphs

- **fullgraph**: Compile entire model as single graph without breaks
  - `False`: Allow graph breaks for better compatibility (default, recommended)
  - `True`: Enforce no breaks for maximum optimization (may fail with dynamic shapes)

- **dynamic**: Handle varying input shapes without recompilation
  - `False`: Specialize for exact input shapes (default)
  - `True`: Create dynamic kernels that adapt to shape variations (enable when processing different resolutions or batch sizes)

- **dynamo_cache_size_limit**: Max cached compiled versions per function (default: 64)
  - Higher = more memory, lower = more recompilation

- **dynamo_recompile_limit**: Max recompilation attempts before falling back to eager mode (default: 128)
  - Safety limit to prevent compilation loops

**Usage:**
1. Add this node to your workflow
2. Connect its output to the `torch_compile_args` input of DiT and/or VAE loader nodes
3. First run will be slow (compilation), subsequent runs will be much faster

**When to use:**
- torch.compile only makes sense when processing **multiple batches, long videos, or many tiles**
- For single images or short clips, the compilation time outweighs the speed improvement
- Best suited for batch processing workflows or long videos

**Recommended Settings:**
- For development/testing: `mode=default`, `backend=inductor`, `fullgraph=False`
- For production: `mode=max-autotune`, `backend=inductor`, `fullgraph=False`

#### 4. SeedVR2 Video Upscaler (Main Node)

![SeedVR2 Video Upscaler](docs/video_upscaler.png)

Main upscaling node that processes video frames using DiT and VAE models.

**Required Inputs:**

- **image**: Input video frames as image batch (RGB or RGBA format)
- **dit**: DiT model configuration from SeedVR2 (Down)Load DiT Model node
- **vae**: VAE model configuration from SeedVR2 (Down)Load VAE Model node

**Parameters:**

- **seed**: Random seed for reproducible generation (default: 42)
  - Same seed with same inputs produces identical output

- **resolution**: Target resolution for shortest edge in pixels (default: 1080)
  - Maintains aspect ratio automatically

- **max_resolution**: Maximum resolution for any edge (default: 0 = no limit)
  - Automatically scales down if exceeded to prevent OOM

- **batch_size**: Frames per batch (default: 5)
  - **CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: Must follow the **4n+1 formula** (1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, ...)
  - **Why this matters**: The model uses these frames for temporal consistency calculations
  - **Minimum 5 for temporal consistency**: Use 1 only for single images or when temporal consistency isn't needed
  - **Match shot length ideally**: For best results, set batch_size to match your shot length (e.g., batch_size=21 for a 20-frame shot)
  - **VRAM impact**: Higher batch_size = better quality and speed but requires more VRAM
  - **If you get OOM with batch_size=5**: Try optimization techniques first (model offloading, BlockSwap, GGUF models...) before reducing batch_size or input resolution, as these directly impact quality

**uniform_batch_size** (default: False)
  - Pads the final batch to match `batch_size` for uniform processing
  - Prevents temporal artifacts when the last batch is significantly smaller than others
  - Example: 45 frames with `batch_size=33` creates [33, 33] instead of [33, 12]
  - Recommended when using large batch sizes and video length is not a multiple of `batch_size`
  - Increases VRAM usage slightly but ensures consistent temporal coherence across all batches

- **temporal_overlap**: Overlapping frames between batches (default: 0)
  - Used for blending between batches to reduce temporal artifacts
  - Range: 0-16 frames

- **prepend_frames**: Frames to prepend (default: 0)
  - Prepends reversed frames to reduce artifacts at video start
  - Automatically removed after processing
  - Range: 0-32 frames

- **color_correction**: Color correction method (default: "wavelet")
  - **`lab`**: Full perceptual color matching with detail preservation (recommended for highest fidelity to original)
  - **`wavelet`**: Frequency-based natural colors, preserves details well
  - **`wavelet_adaptive`**: Wavelet base + targeted saturation correction
  - **`hsv`**: Hue-conditional saturation matching
  - **`adain`**: Statistical style transfer
  - **`none`**: No color correction

- **input_noise_scale**: Input noise injection scale 0.0-1.0 (default: 0.0)
  - Adds noise to input frames to reduce artifacts at very high resolutions
  - Try 0.1-0.3 if you see artifacts with high output resolutions

- **latent_noise_scale**: Latent space noise scale 0.0-1.0 (default: 0.0)
  - Adds noise during diffusion process, can soften excessive detail
  - Use if input_noise doesn't help, try 0.05-0.15

- **offload_device**: Device for storing intermediate tensors between processing phases (default: "cpu")
  - `none`: Keep all tensors on inference device (fastest but highest VRAM)
  - `cpu`: Offload to system RAM (recommended for long videos, slower transfers)
  - `cuda:X`: Offload to another GPU (good balance if available, faster than CPU)

- **enable_debug**: Enable detailed debug logging (default: False)
  - Shows memory usage, timing information, and processing details
  - **Highly recommended** for troubleshooting OOM issues

**Output:**
- Upscaled video frames with color correction applied
- Format (RGB/RGBA) matches input
- Range [0, 1] normalized for ComfyUI compatibility

### Multi-GPU Processing Explained

The CLI's multi-GPU mode uses **frame-level parallelism**: the video is split into chunks and each GPU processes its chunk independently through all 4 phases (encode → upscale → decode → postprocess). This is ideal for long videos where you want to reduce total processing time by dividing the workload.

**How it works:**
1. Video frames are split evenly across GPUs (e.g., 100 frames on 2 GPUs → 50 frames each)
2. Each GPU loads its own copy of the models and processes its chunk independently
3. When `--temporal_overlap` is set, chunks include overlapping frames for seamless blending
4. Results are concatenated (and blended at overlap regions) into the final video

**Example for 100 frames on 2 GPUs with temporal_overlap=4:**
```
GPU 0: Frames 0-53 (50 base + 4 overlap at end, processed as independent video)
GPU 1: Frames 50-99 (50 frames, 4 overlap at start, processed as independent video)
Result: Frames 0-99 with smooth blending at the transition point
```

**Important considerations:**
- Each GPU processes its chunk as a separate video with its own batch splitting
- `batch_size` controls batching *within* each GPU's chunk, not across GPUs
- For short videos (< 100 frames), single GPU is often more efficient due to model loading overhead
- Multi-GPU doubles VRAM usage (each GPU loads full models) but roughly halves processing time

**When to use multi-GPU:**
- Long videos (100+ frames) where splitting provides significant time savings
- When you have multiple GPUs with sufficient VRAM each

**When to use single GPU:**
- Short videos where model loading overhead outweighs parallel gains
- When you want all frames processed together for maximum temporal coherence

**Best practices:**
- Set `--temporal_overlap` to 2-4 frames for smooth blending between GPU chunks
- Higher overlap = smoother transitions but more redundant processing
- Use `--prepend_frames` to reduce artifacts at video start
- For optimal quality on short videos, use single GPU with `batch_size` matching your shot length

## ⚠️ Limitations

### Model Limitations

**Batch Size Constraint**: The model requires batch_size to follow the **4n+1 formula** (1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, ...) due to temporal consistency architecture. All frames in a batch are processed together for temporal coherence, then batches can be blended using temporal_overlap. Ideally, set batch_size to match your shot length for optimal quality.

### Performance Considerations

**VAE Bottleneck**: Even with optimized DiT upscaling (BlockSwap, GGUF, torch.compile), the VAE encoding/decoding stages can be the bottleneck, especially for high resolutions. The VAE is slow. Use large batch_size to mitigate this.

**VRAM Usage**: While the integration now supports low VRAM systems (8GB or less with proper optimization), VRAM usage varies based on:
- Input/output resolution (larger = more VRAM)
- Batch size (higher = more VRAM but better temporal consistency and speed)
- Model choice (FP16 > FP8 > GGUF in VRAM usage)
- Optimization settings (BlockSwap, VAE tiling significantly reduce VRAM)

**Speed**: Processing speed depends on:
- GPU capabilities (compute performance, VRAM bandwidth, and architecture generation)
- Model size (3B faster than 7B)
- Batch size (larger batch sizes are faster per frame due to better GPU utilization)
- Optimization settings (torch.compile provides significant speedup)
- Resolution (higher resolutions are slower)

### Best Practices

1. **Start with debug enabled** to understand where VRAM is being used
2. **For OOM errors during encoding**: Enable VAE encode tiling and reduce tile size
3. **For OOM errors during upscaling**: Enable BlockSwap and increase blocks_to_swap
4. **For OOM errors during decoding**: Enable VAE decode tiling and reduce tile size
   - **If still getting OOM after trying all above**: Reduce batch_size or resolution
5. **For best quality**: Use higher batch_size matching your shot length, FP16 models, and LAB color correction
6. **For speed**: Use FP8/GGUF models, enable torch.compile, and use Flash Attention if available
7. **Test settings with a short clip first** before processing long videos
