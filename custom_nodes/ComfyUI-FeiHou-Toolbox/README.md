### Create SCAIL-2 Colored Mask V2

An enhanced version of ComfyUI's original SCAIL-2 colored mask node, built for mask routing, separation, and batch handling in multi-reference workflows.

`prefix_mask_mode` supports:

- `Multi Image Single Color`: each output batch image is single-color, matching the current `reference_image_mask` foreground color.
- `Multi Image Multi Color`: each output batch image uses the node's object color palette rule.
- `Single Image Multi Color`: output batch images use batch-order colors: blue, red, green, magenta, cyan, then loop after 5 images.

`render_device` supports:

- `gpu`: renders masks on the graphics card for speed, using VRAM.
- `cpu`: offloads mask rendering to system memory to reduce VRAM use, at a slower speed.

### Auto Ref Collage

Automatically uses SAM3/SAM3.1 to cut people out from multiple reference images and compose them into a single multi-person reference collage.

### Manual Ref Collage (v2.2.2)

A manual collage node that loads SAM3/SAM3.1 cutouts onto an editable canvas, allowing users to adjust position and scale before outputting the final composed image.

### Switch V2

A revised switch node for toggling between two workflow paths while reducing issues caused by inactive branches.

### Invert Boolean

An input-only boolean node that inverts `true` to `false` and `false` to `true`. It is compatible with `PrimitiveBoolean` output chains.

### Image Batch Multi V2

A copy-style variant of KJNodes `ImageBatchMulti` for creating a batch from multiple image inputs. It keeps the dynamic input-count workflow, but skips missing or bypassed image inputs instead of adding black placeholder frames. If no image input is available, it returns no image output.

### Fast Groups Bypass Switch (v2.0)

A group bypass and switch node that binds two ComfyUI Groups, switches which group is active, bypasses the inactive group, and outputs the corresponding input.

## Changelog

### v2.9.4

- Made every Video Combine V2 widget input optional with a backend default. A frontend that omits a widget value can no longer fail prompt validation with `Required input is missing: loop_count`.

### v2.9.3

- Bundled the original VHS numeric widgets in Video Combine V2. `frame_rate` and `loop_count` now remain normal widgets when VideoHelperSuite is not installed, instead of becoming required sockets.

### v2.9.2

- Fixed Video Combine V2 widget inputs being incorrectly treated as required connections (including `loop_count`).
- Vendored the complete VideoHelperSuite Video Combine backend, so Video Combine V2 works without a separate ComfyUI-VideoHelperSuite installation.
- Kept the original full format, batching, VAE, audio, and preview logic; video output embeds workflow metadata, while audio output leaves only one final video and no first-frame PNG.

### v2.9.1

- Restored the original VideoHelperSuite Video Combine execution, preview-state restoration, batch support, and VHS filename output in Video Combine V2.
- Video Combine V2 keeps only one final audio video, embeds ComfyUI metadata, and does not save the original first-frame PNG sidecar.

### v2.9.0

- Added `Video Combine 🎥🅥🅗🅢 V2`, based on VideoHelperSuite's Video Combine interface, format presets, VAE/LATENT handling, date-prefix handling, and preview behavior.
- When audio is connected, Video Combine V2 writes one final video file containing the video stream, audio stream, and ComfyUI prompt/workflow metadata.
- Restored the complete VideoHelperSuite format list and per-format dynamic widgets. The preview auto-plays muted and enables audio while hovered.

### v2.8

- Added `RandomSeedNoise`, a rgthree-style random seed controller that outputs standard `NOISE` for `SamplerCustomAdvanced`.

### v2.6

- Changed the render device to `gpu` and `cpu` options. `gpu` is the default; if a long video runs out of VRAM, manually switch to `cpu`.

### v2.5

- Optimized SAM3/SAM3.1 cutout memory usage in `AutoRefCollage` and `ManualRefCollage`.
- Wrapped CLIP prompt encoding and SAM3 inference in `torch.no_grad()` to avoid retaining inference graphs during preview loading and workflow execution.
- Reduced the matched-object refinement peak by keeping only the best mask/box before refinement and avoiding a full original-image GPU copy before cropping.

### v2.4

- Added `ImageBatchMultiV2` (`Image Batch Multi V2` / `图像组合批次（多重）V2`), based on KJNodes `ImageBatchMulti`.
- Kept the original dynamic `inputcount` and `Update inputs` workflow.
- Changed missing-input handling: unconnected or bypassed image inputs are skipped instead of being replaced by black frames.
- If no image inputs are available, the node returns no image output.

### v2.3

- Added `InvertBoolean` (`Invert Boolean` / `反转布尔值`), a single-input single-output boolean inverter.
- The node is compatible with `PrimitiveBoolean` output chains and flips `true` to `false`, `false` to `true`.

### v2.2.2

- Changed `ManualRefCollage` size handling so the manual canvas reads and applies current `width` / `height` inputs only when `应用尺寸` is clicked.
- `ManualRefCollage` no longer auto-applies linked width/height during node creation, connection changes, or `载入图片`, avoiding early reads before KJNodes `Set` / `Get` variable chains are ready.
- Added compatibility for KJNodes-style `Set_variable` / `Get_variable` width and height routing; clicking `应用尺寸` now attempts to resolve the matching `Set` node and read the value from its input chain.

### v2.2.1

- Fixed `ManualRefCollage` not correctly reading externally connected `width` / `height` inputs in both the frontend manual canvas and backend execution.
- Manual collage now prioritizes linked width/height inputs and falls back to the node's own width/height widgets only when linked values cannot be resolved.

### v2.2

- Updated `Create SCAIL-2 Colored Mask V2` `prefix_mask_mode` behavior.
- `Multi Image Single Color` renders every output batch image as a single color matching the current `reference_image_mask` foreground color.
- Added `Multi Image Multi Color` for rendering every output batch image with the node's object color palette rule.
- `Single Image Multi Color` renders output batch images with batch-order colors: blue, red, green, magenta, cyan, then loops after 5 images.

### v2.1

- Fixed `ManualRefCollage` preview loading images from ignored/bypassed inputs.
- Fixed ignored/bypassed image inputs still being included during manual collage execution.
- Fixed externally connected `width` / `height` being overridden by stale `layout_json` dimensions.

### v2.0

- Added `FastGroupsBypassSwitch` (`多框忽略并切换`).
- Supports enabling, bypassing, and output switching between two ComfyUI Groups.
- UI follows the rgthree Fast Groups Bypasser style for large grouped workflows.

### v1.5

- Finalized `ManualRefCollage` (`多参图像手动拼接`).
- Supports SAM3/SAM3.1 cutouts and manual layout for up to 5 reference images.
- Supports using the first video frame as a composition reference while keeping the final output on a black or white background.

### v1.0

- Initial release.
- Added `Create SCAIL-2 Colored Mask V2`.
- Added `AutoRefCollage`.
